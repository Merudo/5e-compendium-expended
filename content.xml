          <value class="string">{&quot;Level 0&quot;:{&quot;Prestidigitation&quot;:&quot;*Transmutation cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 10 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Up to 1 hour  \n\n---\n\nThis spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:\n\n- You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.\n- You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.\n- You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.\n- You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.\n- You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.\n- You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.\n\nIf you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.&quot;,&quot;Mage Hand&quot;:&quot;*Conjuration cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 30 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** 1 minute  \n\n---\n\nA spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.\n\nYou can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.\n\nThe hand can&apos;t attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.&quot;,&quot;Fire Bolt&quot;:&quot;*Evocation cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 120 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n\n---\n\nYou hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes [1d10 fire damage](roll \&quot;1d10\&quot;). A flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isn&apos;t being worn or carried.\n\nThis spell&apos;s damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level ([2d10](roll \&quot;2d10\&quot;)), 11th level ([3d10](roll \&quot;3d10\&quot;)), and 17th level ([4d10](roll \&quot;4d10\&quot;)).&quot;,&quot;Thaumaturgy&quot;:&quot;*Transmutation cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 30 feet  \n**Components:** V  \n**Duration:** Up to 1 minute\n\n---\n\nYou manifest a minor wonder, a sign of supernatural power, within range. You create one of the following magical effects within range:\n\n- Your voice booms up to three times as loud as normal for 1 minute.\n- You cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color for 1 minute.\n- You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1 minute.\n- You create an instantaneous sound that originates from a point of your choice within range, such as a rumble of thunder, the cry of a raven, or ominous whispers.\n- You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window to fly open or slam shut.\n- You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute.\n\nIf you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its 1-minute effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.\n&quot;,&quot;Acid Splash&quot;:&quot;*Conjuration cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 60 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n\n---\n\nYou hurl a bubble of acid. Choose one creature you can see within range, or choose two creatures you can see within range that are within 5 feet of each other. A target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take [1d6 acid damage](roll \&quot;1d6\&quot;).\n\nThis spell&apos;s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level ([2d6](roll \&quot;2d6\&quot;)), 11th level ([3d6](roll \&quot;3d6\&quot;)), and 17th level ([4d6](roll \&quot;4d6\&quot;)).&quot;,&quot;Blade Ward&quot;:&quot;*Abjuration cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** 1 round  \n\n---\n\nYou extend your hand and trace a sigil of warding in the air. Until the end of your next turn, you have resistance against bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage dealt by weapon attacks.&quot;,&quot;Chill Touch&quot;:&quot;*Necromancy cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 120 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** 1 round  \n\n---\n\nYou create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it with the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes [1d8 necrotic damage](roll \&quot;1d8\&quot;), and it can&apos;t regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target.\n\nIf you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn.\n\nThis spell&apos;s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level ([2d8](roll \&quot;2d8\&quot;)), 11th level ([3d8](roll \&quot;3d8\&quot;)), and 17th level ([4d8](roll \&quot;4d8\&quot;)).&quot;,&quot;Dancing Lights&quot;:&quot;*Evocation cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 120 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or a glowworm)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute  \n\n---\n\nYou create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.\n\nAs a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell&apos;s range.&quot;,&quot;Friends&quot;:&quot;*Enchantment cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** S, M (a small amount of makeup applied to the face as this spell is cast)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute  \n\n---\n\nFor the duration, you have advantage on all Charisma checks directed at one creature of your choice that isn&apos;t hostile toward you. When the spell ends, the creature realizes that you used magic to influence its mood and becomes hostile toward you. A creature prone to violence might attack you. Another creature might seek retribution in other ways (at the DM&apos;s discretion), depending on the nature of your interaction with it.&quot;,&quot;Light&quot;:&quot;*Evocation cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, M (a firefly or phosphorescent moss)  \n**Duration:** 1 hour  \n\n---\n\nYou touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.\n\nIf you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.&quot;,&quot;Mending&quot;:&quot;*Transmutation cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 minute  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S, M (two lodestones)  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n\n---\n\nThis spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.\n\nThis spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can&apos;t restore magic to such an object.&quot;,&quot;Minor Illusion&quot;:&quot;*Illusion cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 30 feet  \n**Components:** S, M (a bit of fleece)  \n**Duration:** 1 minute  \n\n---\n\nYou create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.\n\nIf you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else&apos;s voice, a lion&apos;s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.\n\nIf you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can&apos;t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.\n\nIf a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.&quot;,&quot;Poison Spray&quot;:&quot;*Conjuration cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 10 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n\n---\n\nYou extend your hand toward a creature you can see within range and project a puff of noxious gas from your palm. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take [1d12 poison damage](roll \&quot;1d12\&quot;).\n\nThis spell&apos;s damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th level ([2d12](roll \&quot;2d12\&quot;)), 11th level ([3d12](roll \&quot;3d12\&quot;)), and 17th level ([4d12](roll \&quot;4d12\&quot;)).&quot;,&quot;Ray of Frost&quot;:&quot;*Evocation cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 60 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n\n---\n\nA frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes [1d8 cold damage](roll \&quot;1d8\&quot;), and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.\n\nThe spell&apos;s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level ([2d8](roll \&quot;2d8\&quot;)), 11th level ([3d8](roll \&quot;3d8\&quot;)), and 17th level ([4d8](roll \&quot;4d8\&quot;)).&quot;,&quot;Shocking Grasp&quot;:&quot;*Evocation cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n\n---\n\nLightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target takes [1d8 lightning damage](roll \&quot;1d8\&quot;), and it can&apos;t take reactions until the start of its next turn.\n\nThe spell&apos;s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level ([2d8](roll \&quot;2d8\&quot;)), 11th level ([3d8](roll \&quot;3d8\&quot;)), and 17th level ([4d8](roll \&quot;4d8\&quot;)).&quot;,&quot;True Strike&quot;:&quot;*Divination cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 30 feet  \n**Components:** S  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 round  \n\n---\n\nYou extend your hand and point a finger at a target in range. Your magic grants you a brief insight into the target&apos;s defenses. On your next turn, you gain advantage on your first attack roll against the target, provided that this spell hasn&apos;t ended.&quot;,&quot;Shillelagh&quot;:&quot;[h:encode(\&quot;Spell Attack\&quot;)]\n\n*Transmutation cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S, M (mistletoe, a shamrock leaf, and a club or quarterstaff)  \n**Duration:** 1 minute\n\n---\n\nThe wood of a club or quarterstaff you are holding is imbued with nature&apos;s power. For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon&apos;s damage die becomes a [d8](roll \&quot;1d8+spell\&quot;). The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn&apos;t already. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.\n\n\n&quot;,&quot;Resistance&quot;:&quot;*Abjuration cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a miniature cloak)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\n\n---\n\nYou touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a [d4](roll \&quot;1d4\&quot;) and add the number rolled to one saving throw of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the saving throw. The spell then ends.&quot;,&quot;Produce Flame&quot;:&quot;*Conjuration cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self  \nComponents:** V, S  \n**Duration:** 10 minutes\n\n---\n\nA flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.\n\nYou can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes [1d8 fire damage](roll \&quot;1d8\&quot;).\n\nThis spell&apos;s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level ([2d8](roll \&quot;2d8\&quot;)), 11th level ([3d8](roll \&quot;3d8\&quot;)), and 17th level ([4d8](roll \&quot;4d8\&quot;)).&quot;,&quot;Guidance&quot;:&quot;*Divination cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\n\n---\n\nYou touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a [d4](roll \&quot;1d4\&quot;) and add the number rolled to one ability check of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the ability check. The spell then ends.&quot;,&quot;Druidcraft&quot;:&quot;*Transmutation cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 30 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nWhispering to the spirits of nature, you create one of the following effects within range:\n\n- You create a tiny, harmless sensory effect that predicts what the weather will be at your location for the next 24 hours. The effect might manifest as a golden orb for clear skies, a cloud for rain, falling snowflakes for snow, and so on. This effect persists for 1 round.\n- You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom.\n- You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as falling leaves, a puff of wind, the sound of a small animal, or the faint odor of skunk. The effect must fit in a 5-foot cube.\n- You instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.&quot;,&quot;Frostbite&quot;:&quot;*Evocation cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 60 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nYou cause numbing frost to form on one creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes [1d6 cold damage](roll \&quot;1d6\&quot;), and it has disadvantage on the next weapon attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.\n\nThe spell&apos;s damage increases by [1d6](roll \&quot;1d6\&quot;) when you reach 5th level ([2d6](roll \&quot;2d6\&quot;)), 11th level ([3d6](roll \&quot;3d6\&quot;)), and 17th level ([4d6](roll \&quot;4d6\&quot;)).&quot;,&quot;Eldritch Blast&quot;:&quot;*Evocation cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 120 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nA beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes [1d10 force damage](roll \&quot;1d10\&quot;).\n\nThe spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.&quot;,&quot;Vicious Mockery&quot;:&quot;*Enchantment cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 60 feet  \n**Components:** V  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nYou unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take [1d4 psychic damage](roll \&quot;1d4\&quot;) and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.\n\nThis spell&apos;s damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level ([2d4](roll \&quot;2d4\&quot;)), 11th level ([3d4](roll \&quot;3d4\&quot;)), and 17th level ([4d4](roll \&quot;4d4\&quot;)).&quot;,&quot;Sacred Flame&quot;:&quot;*Evocation cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 60 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nFlame-like radiance descends on a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take [1d8](roll \&quot;1d8\&quot;) radiant damage. The target gains no benefit from cover for this saving throw.\n\nThe spell&apos;s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level ([2d8](roll \&quot;2d8\&quot;)), 11th level ([3d8](roll \&quot;4d8\&quot;)), and 17th level ([4d8](roll \&quot;4d8\&quot;)).&quot;,&quot;Spare the Dying&quot;:&quot;*Necromancy cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nYou touch a living creature that has 0 hit points. The creature becomes stable. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.&quot;},&quot;Level 1&quot;:{&quot;Bless&quot;:&quot;*1st-level enchantment*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 30 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a sprinkling of holy water)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\n\n---\n\nYou bless up to three creatures of your choice within range. Whenever a target makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the target can roll a [d4](roll \&quot;1d4\&quot;) and add the number rolled to the attack roll or saving throw.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.&quot;,&quot;Cure Wounds&quot;:&quot;*1st-level evocation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nA creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to [1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier](roll \&quot;1d8+spell\&quot;). This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by [1d8](roll \&quot;1d8+1d8*slot1+spell\&quot;) for each slot level above 1st.&quot;,&quot;Protection from Evil and Good&quot;:&quot;*1st-level abjuration*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron, which the spell consumes)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes\n\n---\n\nUntil the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.\n\nThe protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can&apos;t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.&quot;,&quot;Sanctuary&quot;:&quot;*1st-level abjuration*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  \n**Range:** 30 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a small silver mirror)  \n**Duration:** 1 minute  \n\n---\n\nYou ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn&apos;t protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.\n\nIf the warded creature makes an attack, casts a spell that affects an enemy, or deals damage to another creature, this spell ends.&quot;,&quot;Disguise Self&quot;:&quot;*1st-level illusion*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** 1 hour\n\n---\n\nYou make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person—look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can&apos;t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.\n\nThe changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.\n\nTo discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.&quot;,&quot;Sleep&quot;:&quot;*1st-level enchantment*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 90 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a cricket)  \n**Duration:** 1 minute\n\n---\n\nThis spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll [5d8](roll \&quot;5d8\&quot;); the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures).\n\nStarting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature&apos;s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature&apos;s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.\n\nUndead and creatures immune to being charmed aren&apos;t affected by this spell.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional [2d8](roll \&quot;5d8+2d8*slot1\&quot;) for each slot level above 1st.&quot;,&quot;Healing Word&quot;:&quot;*1st-level evocation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  \n**Range:** 60 feet  \n**Components:** V  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nA creature of your choice that you can see within range regains hit points equal to [1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier](roll \&quot;1d4+spell\&quot;). This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by [1d4](roll \&quot;1d4+1d4*slot1+spell\&quot;) for each slot level above 1st.&quot;,&quot;Unseen Servant&quot;:&quot;*1st-level conjuration (ritual)*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 60 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of string and a bit of wood)  \n**Duration:** 1 hour  \n\n---\n\nThis spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless, Medium force that performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can&apos;t attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.\n\nOnce on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.\n\nIf you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.&quot;,&quot;Mage Armor&quot;:&quot;*1st-level abjuration*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of cured leather)  \n**Duration:** 8 hours\n\n---\n\nYou touch a willing creature who isn&apos;t wearing armor, and a protective magical force surrounds it until the spell ends. The target&apos;s base AC becomes 13 + its Dexterity modifier. The spell ends if the target dons armor or if you dismiss the spell as an action.&quot;,&quot;Magic Missile&quot;:&quot;*1st-level evocation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 120 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nYou create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals [1d4 + 1](roll \&quot;1d4+1\&quot;) force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.\n\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell creates one more dart for each slot level above 1st.&quot;,&quot;Shield&quot;:&quot;*1st-level abjuration**  \n**Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you are hit by an attack or targeted by the magic missile spell  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** 1 round\n\n---\n\nAn invisible barrier of magical force appears and protects you. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and you take no damage from magic missile.&quot;,&quot;Detect Evil and Good&quot;:&quot;*1st-level divination*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes\n\n---\n\nFor the duration, you know if there is an aberration, celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead within 30 feet of you, as well as where the creature is located. Similarly, you know if there is a place or object within 30 feet of you that has been magically consecrated or desecrated.\n\nThe spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.&quot;,&quot;Detect Poison and Disease&quot;:&quot;*1st-level divination (ritual)*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a yew leaf)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes\n\n---\n\nFor the duration, you can sense the presence and location of poisons, poisonous creatures, and diseases within 30 feet of you. You also identify the kind of poison, poisonous creature, or disease in each case.\n\nThe spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.&quot;,&quot;Guiding Bolt&quot;:&quot;*1st-level evocation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 120 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** 1 round\n\n---\n\nA flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes [4d6](roll \&quot;4d6\&quot;) radiant damage, and the next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn has advantage, thanks to the mystical dim light glittering on the target until then.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by [1d6](roll \&quot;4d6+1d6*slot1\&quot;) for each slot level above 1st.&quot;,&quot;Charm Person&quot;:&quot;*1st-level enchantment*  \nCasting Time: 1 action  \nRange: 30 feet  \nComponents: V, S  \nDuration: 1 hour\n\n---\n\nYou attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.&quot;,&quot;Faerie Fire&quot;:&quot;*1st-level evocation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 60 feet  \n**Components:** V  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\n\n---\n\nEach object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Any creature in the area when the spell is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.\n\nAny attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can&apos;t benefit from being invisible.&quot;,&quot;Burning Hands&quot;:&quot;*1st-level evocation*  \n***Casting Time:*** 1 action  \n***Range:*** Self (15-foot cone)  \n***Components:*** V, S  \n***Duration:*** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nAs you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes [3d6](roll \&quot;3d6\&quot;) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nThe fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren&apos;t being worn or carried.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by [1d6](roll \&quot;3d6+1d6*slot1\&quot;) for each slot level above 1st.&quot;,&quot;Detect Magic&quot;:&quot;*1st-level divination (ritual)*  \n***Casting Time:*** 1 action  \n***Range:*** Self  \n***Components:*** V, S  \n***Duration:*** Concentration, up to 10 minutes\n\n---\n\nFor the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.\n\nThe spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.&quot;,&quot;Thunderwave&quot;:&quot;*1st-level evocation*  \n***Casting Time:*** 1 action  \n***Range:*** Self (15-foot cube)  \n***Components:*** V, S  \n***Duration:*** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nA wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes [2d8](roll \&quot;2d8\&quot;) thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn&apos;t pushed.\n\nIn addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell&apos;s effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.\n\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by [1d8](roll \&quot;2d8+1d8*slot1\&quot;) for each slot level above 1st.&quot;,&quot;Healing Elixir&quot;:&quot;*1st-level conjuration*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 minute  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V, S, M (alchemist&apos;s supplies)  \n**Duration:** 24 hours  \n\n---\n\nYou create a healing elixir in a simple vial that appears in your hand. The elixir retains its potency for the duration or until it&apos;s consumed, at which point the vial vanishes.\n\nAs an action, a creature can drink the elixir or administer it to another creature. The drinker regains [2d4 + 2](roll \&quot;2d4+2\&quot;) hit points.&quot;,&quot;Sense Emotion&quot;:&quot;*1st-level divination*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes\n\n---\n\nYou attune your senses to pick up the emotions of others for the duration. When you cast the spell, and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your senses on one humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you. You instantly learn the target&apos;s prevailing emotion, whether it&apos;s love, anger, pain, fear, calm, or something else. If the target isn&apos;t actually humanoid or it is immune to being charmed, you sense that it is calm.&quot;},&quot;Level 2&quot;:{&quot;Invisibility&quot;:&quot;*2nd-level illusion*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S, M (an eyelash encased in gum arabic)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour\n\n---\n\nA creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target&apos;s person. The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.&quot;,&quot;Pass without Trace&quot;:&quot;*2nd-level abjuration*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V, S, M (ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour\n\n---\n\nA veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can&apos;t be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.&quot;,&quot;Hold Person&quot;:&quot;*2nd-level enchantment*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 60 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a small, straight piece of iron)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\n\n---\n\nChoose a humanoid that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional humanoid for each slot level above 2nd. The humanoids must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.&quot;,&quot;Spike Growth&quot;:&quot;*2nd-level transmutation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 150 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a point)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes\n\n---\n\nThe ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes [2d4 piercing damage](roll \&quot;2d4\&quot;) for every 5 feet it travels.\n\nThe transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can&apos;t see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.&quot;,&quot;Mirror Image&quot;:&quot;*2nd-level illusion*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** 1 minute\n\n---\n\nThree illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it&apos;s impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.\n\nEach time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell&apos;s duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.\n\nIf you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack&apos;s target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.\n\nA duplicate&apos;s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.\n\nA creature is unaffected by this spell if it can&apos;t see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.&quot;,&quot;Misty Step&quot;:&quot;*2nd-level conjuration*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nBriefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.&quot;,&quot;Blur&quot;:&quot;*2nd-level illusion*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\n\n---\n\nYour body becomes blurred, shifting and wavering to all who can see you. For the duration, any creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against you. An attacker is immune to this effect if it doesn&apos;t rely on sight, as with blindsight, or can see through illusions, as with truesight.&quot;,&quot;Silence&quot;:&quot;*2nd-level illusion (ritual)*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 120 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes\n\n---\n\nFor the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.&quot;,&quot;Barkskin&quot;:&quot;*2nd-level transmutation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a handful of oak bark)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour\n\n---\n\nYou touch a willing creature. Until the spell ends, the target&apos;s skin has a rough, bark-like appearance, and the target&apos;s AC can&apos;t be less than 16, regardless of what kind of armor it is wearing.&quot;,&quot;Darkness&quot;:&quot;*2nd-level evocation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 60 feet  \n**Components:** V, M (bat fur and a drop of pitch or piece of coal)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes\n\n---\n\nMagical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 15-foot-radius sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can&apos;t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can&apos;t illuminate it.\n\nIf the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn&apos;t being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.\n\nIf any of this spell&apos;s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.&quot;,&quot;Melf&apos;s Acid Arrow&quot;:&quot;*2nd-level evocation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 90 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (powdered rhubarb leaf and an adder&apos;s stomach)  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nA shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes [4d4 acid damage](roll \&quot;4d4\&quot;) immediately and [2d4 acid damage](roll \&quot;2d4\&quot;) at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both [initial](roll \&quot;4d4+1d4slot2\&quot;) and [later](roll \&quot;2d4+1d4slot2\&quot;)) increases by [1d4](roll \&quot;1d4slot2\&quot;) for each slot level above 2nd.&quot;,&quot;Spider Climb&quot;:&quot;*2nd-level transmutation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of bitumen and a spider)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour\n\n---\n\nUntil the spell ends, one willing creature you touch gains the ability to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving its hands free. The target also gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed.&quot;,&quot;Web&quot;:&quot;*2nd-level conjuration*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 60 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour\n\n---\n\nYou conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.\n\nIf the webs aren&apos;t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.\n\nEach creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.\n\nA creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.\n\nThe webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.&quot;},&quot;Level 3&quot;:{&quot;Fireball&quot;:&quot;\n*3rd-level evocation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 150 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n\n---\n\nA bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes [8d6 fire damage](roll \&quot;8d6\&quot;) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nThe fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren&apos;t being worn or carried.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by [1d6](roll \&quot;8d6+1d6*slot3\&quot;) for each slot level above 3rd.&quot;,&quot;Counterspell&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level abjuration*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell  \n**Range:** 60 feet  \n**Components:** S  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nYou attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell&apos;s level. On a success, the creature&apos;s spell fails and has no effect.\n\n***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used.&quot;,&quot;Mass Healing Word&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level evocation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  \n**Range:** 60 feet  \n**Components:** V  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nAs you call out words of restoration, up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range regain hit points equal to [1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier](roll \&quot;1d4+spell\&quot;). This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the healing increases by [1d4](roll \&quot;1d4+1d4*slot3+spell\&quot;) for each slot level above 3rd.&quot;,&quot;Sleet Storm&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level conjuration*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 150 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\n\n---\n\nUntil the spell ends, freezing rain and sleet fall in a 20-foot-tall cylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. The area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused.\n\nThe ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it difficult terrain. When a creature enters the spell&apos;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone.\n\nIf a creature starts its turn in the spell&apos;s area and is concentrating on a spell, the creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose concentration.&quot;,&quot;Slow&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level transmutation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 120 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of molasses)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\n\n---\n\nYou alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.\n\nAn affected target&apos;s speed is halved, it takes a −2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can&apos;t use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature&apos;s abilities or magic items, it can&apos;t make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.\n\nIf the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a [d20](roll \&quot;1d20\&quot;). On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn&apos;t take effect until the creature&apos;s next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can&apos;t, the spell is wasted.\n\nA creature affected by this spell makes another Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.&quot;,&quot;Water Breathing&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level transmutation (ritual)*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 30 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a short reed or piece of straw)  \n**Duration:** 24 hours\n\n---\n\nThis spell grants up to ten willing creatures you can see within range the ability to breathe underwater until the spell ends. Affected creatures also retain their normal mode of respiration.&quot;,&quot;Create Food and Water&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level conjuration*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 30 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nYou create 45 pounds of food and 30 gallons of water on the ground or in containers within range, enough to sustain up to fifteen humanoids or five steeds for 24 hours. The food is bland but nourishing, and spoils if uneaten after 24 hours. The water is clean and doesn&apos;t go bad.&quot;,&quot;Protection from Energy&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level abjuration*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour\n\n---\n\nFor the duration, the willing creature you touch has resistance to one damage type of your choice: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.\n&quot;,&quot;Call Lightning&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level conjuration*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 120 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes\n\n---\n\nA storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see within range directly above you. The spell fails if you can&apos;t see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can&apos;t accommodate the cloud).\n\nWhen you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes [3d10 lightning damage](roll \&quot;3d10\&quot;) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.\n\nIf you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell&apos;s damage increases by [1d10](roll \&quot;1d10\&quot;).\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher level, the damage increases by [1d10](roll \&quot;3d10+1d10*slot3\&quot;) for each slot level above 3rd.&quot;,&quot;Plant Growth&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level transmutation*  \nCasting Time: 1 action or 8 hours  \nRange: 150 feet  \nComponents: V, S  \nDuration: Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nThis spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits.\n\nIf you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.\n\nYou can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell&apos;s area from being affected.\n\nIf you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.&quot;,&quot;Daylight&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level evocation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 60 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** 1 hour\n\n---\n\nA 60-foot-radius sphere of light spreads out from a point you choose within range. The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for an additional 60 feet.\n\nIf you chose a point on an object you are holding or one that isn&apos;t being worn or carried, the light shines from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the affected object with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the light.\n\nIf any of this spell&apos;s area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.\n&quot;,&quot;Haste&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level transmutation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 30 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a shaving of licorice root)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\n\n---\n\nChoose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target&apos;s speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.\n\nWhen the spell ends, the target can&apos;t move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.&quot;,&quot;Lightning Bolt&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level evocation*  \nCasting Time: 1 action  \nRange: Self (100-foot line)  \nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of fur and a rod of amber, crystal, or glass)  \nDuration: Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nA stroke of lightning forming a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes [8d6](roll \&quot;8d6\&quot;) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nThe lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren&apos;t being worn or carried.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by [1d6](roll \&quot;8d6+1d6*slot3\&quot;) for each slot level above 3rd.&quot;,&quot;Meld into Stone&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level transmutation (ritual)*  \nCasting Time: 1 action  \nRange: Touch  \nComponents: V, S  \nDuration: 8 hours\n\n---\n\nYou step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, melding yourself and all the equipment you carry with the stone for the duration. Using your movement, you step into the stone at a point you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses.\n\nWhile merged with the stone, you can&apos;t see what occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use your movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the spell. You otherwise can&apos;t move.\n\nMinor physical damage to the stone doesn&apos;t harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals [6d6 bludgeoning damage](roll \&quot;6d6\&quot;) to you. The stone&apos;s complete destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals 50 bludgeoning damage to you. If expelled, you fall prone in an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered.&quot;,&quot;Water Walk&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level transmutation (ritual)*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 30 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of cork)  \n**Duration:** 1 hour\n\n---\n\nThis spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface—such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava—as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this ability for the duration.\n\nIf you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the spell carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round.&quot;,&quot;Gaseous Form&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level transmutation*  \nCasting Time: 1 action  \nRange: Touch  \nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of gauze and a wisp of smoke)  \nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\n\n---\n\nYou transform a willing creature you touch, along with everything it&apos;s wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration. The spell ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature isn&apos;t affected.\n\nWhile in this form, the target&apos;s only method of movement is a flying speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can&apos;t fall and remains hovering in the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated.\n\nWhile in the form of a misty cloud, the target can&apos;t talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can&apos;t be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The target can&apos;t attack or cast spells.&quot;,&quot;Stinking Cloud&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level conjuration*  \nCasting Time: 1 action  \nRange: 90 feet  \nComponents: V, S, M (a rotten egg or several skunk cabbage leaves)  \nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\n\n---\n\nYou create a 20-foot-radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration.\n\nEach creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling. Creatures that don&apos;t need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw.\n\nA moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.&quot;},&quot;Level 4&quot;:{&quot;Ice Storm&quot;:&quot;*4th-level evocation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 300 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nA hail of rock-hard ice pounds to the ground in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes [2d8 bludgeoning damage](roll \&quot;2d8\&quot;) and [4d6 cold damage](roll \&quot;4d6\&quot;) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nHailstones turn the storm&apos;s area of effect into difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage increases by [1d8](roll \&quot;2d8+1d8*slot4\&quot;) for each slot level above 4th.&quot;,&quot;Control Water&quot;:&quot;*4th-level transmutation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 300 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of water and a pinch of dust)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes\n\n---\n\nUntil the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.\n\n***Flood.*** You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.\n\nIf you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave&apos;s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.\n\nThe water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.\n\n***Part Water.*** You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell&apos;s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.\n\n***Redirect Flow.*** You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell&apos;s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.\n\n***Whirlpool.*** This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.\n\nWhen a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes [2d8 bludgeoning damage](roll \&quot;2d8\&quot;) and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn&apos;t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.\n\nThe first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes [2d8 bludgeoning damage](roll \&quot;2d8\&quot;)&amp;#59 this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.&quot;,&quot;Blight&quot;:&quot;*4th-level necromancy*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 30 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nNecromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes [8d8 necrotic damage](roll \&quot;8d8\&quot;) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\n\nIf you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.\n\nIf you target a nonmagical plant that isn&apos;t a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn&apos;t make a saving throw, it simply withers and dies.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by [1d8](roll \&quot;1d8\&quot;) for each slot level above 4th.&quot;,&quot;Hallucinatory Terrain&quot;:&quot;*4th-level illusion*  \n**Casting Time:** 10 minutes  \n**Range:** 300 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant)  \n**Duration:** 24 hours\n\n---\n\nYou make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren&apos;t changed in appearance.\n\nThe tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn&apos;t obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.&quot;,&quot;Divination&quot;:&quot;*4th-level divination (ritual)*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V, S, M (incense and a sacrificial offering appropriate to your religion, together worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nYour magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god&apos;s servants. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The DM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.\n\nThe spell doesn&apos;t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.\n\nIf you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.&quot;,&quot;Stoneskin&quot;:&quot;*4th-level abjuration*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S, M (diamond dust worth 100 gp, which the spell consumes)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour\n\n---\n\nThis spell turns the flesh of a willing creature you touch as hard as stone. Until the spell ends, the target has resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.&quot;,&quot;Freedom of Movement&quot;:&quot;*4th-level abjuration*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a leather strap, bound around the arm or a similar appendage)  \n**Duration:** 1 hour\n\n---\n\nYou touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target&apos;s movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target&apos;s speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained.\n\nThe target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it grappled. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target&apos;s movement or attacks.&quot;,&quot;Locate Creature&quot;:&quot;*4th-level divination*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fur from a bloodhound)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour\n\n---\n\nDescribe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the creature&apos;s location, as long as that creature is within 1,000 feet of you. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement.\n\nThe spell can locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn), so long as you have seen such a creature up close—within 30 feet—at least once. If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as being under the effects of a polymorph spell, this spell doesn&apos;t locate the creature.\n\nThis spell can&apos;t locate a creature if running water at least 10 feet wide blocks a direct path between you and the creature.&quot;,&quot;Greater Invisibility&quot;:&quot;*4th-level illusion*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\n\n---\n\nYou or a creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target&apos;s person.&quot;,&quot;Stone Shape&quot;:&quot;*4th-level transmutation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S, M (soft clay, which must be worked into roughly the desired shape of the stone object)  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nYou touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn&apos;t possible.&quot;},&quot;Level 5&quot;:{&quot;Cone of Cold&quot;:&quot;*5th-level evocation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self (60-foot cone)  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a small crystal or glass cone)  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nA blast of cold air erupts from your hands. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes [8d8 cold damage](roll \&quot;8d8\&quot;) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nA creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by [1d8](roll \&quot;8d8+1d8*slot5\&quot;) for each slot level above 5th.&quot;,&quot;Conjure Elemental&quot;:&quot;*5th-level conjuration*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 minute  \n**Range:** 90 feet   \n**Components:** V, S, M (burning incense for air, soft clay for earth, sulfur and phosphorus for fire, or water and sand for water)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour\n\n---\n\nYou call forth an elemental servant. Choose an area of air, earth, fire, or water that fills a 10-foot cube within range. An elemental of challenge rating 5 or lower appropriate to the area you chose appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of it. For example, a fire elemental emerges from a bonfire, and an earth elemental rises up from the ground. The elemental disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.\n\nThe elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don&apos;t issue any commands to the elemental, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.\n\nIf your concentration is broken, the elemental doesn&apos;t disappear. Instead, you lose control of the elemental, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled elemental can&apos;t be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.\n\nThe DM has the elemental&apos;s statistics.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th.&quot;,&quot;Commune with Nature&quot;:&quot;*5th-level divination (ritual)*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 minute  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nYou briefly become one with nature and gain knowledge of the surrounding territory. In the outdoors, the spell gives you knowledge of the land within 3 miles of you. In caves and other natural underground settings, the radius is limited to 300 feet. The spell doesn&apos;t function where nature has been replaced by construction, such as in dungeons and towns.\n\nYou instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area:\n\n- terrain and bodies of water\n- prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or peoples\n- powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead\n- influence from other planes of existence\n- buildings\n\nFor example, you could determine the location of powerful undead in the area, the location of major sources of safe drinking water, and the location of any nearby towns.&quot;,&quot;Tree Stride&quot;:&quot;*5th-level conjuration*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\n\n---\n\nYou gain the ability to enter a tree and move from inside it to inside another tree of the same kind within 500 feet. Both trees must be living and at least the same size as you. You must use 5 feet of movement to enter a tree. You instantly know the location of all other trees of the same kind within 500 feet and, as part of the move used to enter the tree, can either pass into one of those trees or step out of the tree you&apos;re in. You appear in a spot of your choice within 5 feet of the destination tree, using another 5 feet of movement. If you have no movement left, you appear within 5 feet of the tree you entered.\n\nYou can use this transportation ability once per round for the duration. You must end each turn outside a tree.&quot;,&quot;Dream&quot;:&quot;*5th-level illusion*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 minute  \n**Range:** Special  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a handful of sand, a dab of ink, and a writing quill plucked from a sleeping bird)  \n**Duration:** 8 hours\n\n---\n\nThis spell shapes a creature&apos;s dreams. Choose a creature known to you as the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that don&apos;t sleep, such as elves, can&apos;t be contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings, but can&apos;t take actions or move.\n\nIf the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target&apos;s dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target&apos;s dreams.\n\nYou can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target&apos;s sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes [3d6 psychic damage](roll \&quot;3d6\&quot;).\n\nIf you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar portion of the target&apos;s body, the target makes its saving throw with disadvantage.&quot;,&quot;Passwall&quot;:&quot;*5th-level transmutation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 30 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of sesame seeds)  \n**Duration:** 1 hour\n\n---\n\nA passage appears at a point of your choice that you can see on a wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, a ceiling, or a floor) within range, and lasts for the duration. You choose the opening&apos;s dimensions: up to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.\n\nWhen the opening disappears, any creatures or objects still in the passage created by the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the surface on which you cast the spell.&quot;,&quot;Wall of Stone&quot;:&quot;*5th-level evocation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 120 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a small block of granite)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes\n\n---\n\nA nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.\n\nIf the wall cuts through a creature&apos;s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.\n\nThe wall can have any shape you desire, though it can&apos;t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn&apos;t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.\n\nIf you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.\n\nThe wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM&apos;s discretion.\n\nIf you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can&apos;t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.&quot;,&quot;Scrying&quot;:&quot;*5th-level divination*  \n**Casting Time:** 10 minutes  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a focus worth at least 1,000 gp, such as a crystal ball, a silver mirror, or a font filled with holy water)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes\n\n---\n\nYou can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. If a target knows you&apos;re casting this spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be observed.\n\n##### Knowledge of Target\n\n|Knowledge|Save Modifier|\n|---|---:|\n|Secondhand (you have heard of the target)|+5|\n|Firsthand (you have met the target)|+0|\n|Familiar (you know the target well)|-5|\n\n##### Connection to Target\n\n|Connection|Save Modifier|\n|---|---:|\n|Likeness or picture|-2|\n|Possession or garment|-4|\n|Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like|-10|\n\nOn a successful save, the target isn&apos;t affected, and you can&apos;t use this spell against it again for 24 hours.\n\nOn a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.\n\nInstead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn&apos;t move.&quot;,&quot;Cloudkill&quot;:&quot;*5th-level conjuration*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 120 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes\n\n---\n\nYou create a 20-foot-radius sphere of poisonous, yellow-green fog centered on a point you choose within range. The fog spreads around corners. It lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses the fog, ending the spell. Its area is heavily obscured.\n\nWhen a creature enters the spell&apos;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes [5d8 poison damage](roll \&quot;5d8\&quot;) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don&apos;t need to breathe.\n\nThe fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the ground. The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by [1d8](roll \&quot;5d8+1d8*slot5\&quot;) for each slot level above 5th.&quot;,&quot;Insect Plague&quot;:&quot;*5th-level conjuration*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 300 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a few grains of sugar, some kernels of grain, and a smear of fat)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes\n\n---\n\nSwarming, biting locusts fill a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere spreads around corners. The sphere remains for the duration, and its area is lightly obscured. The sphere&apos;s area is difficult terrain.\n\nWhen the area appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes [4d10 piercing damage](roll \&quot;4d10\&quot;) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell&apos;s area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by [1d10](roll \&quot;4d10+1d10*slot5\&quot;) for each slot level above 5th.&quot;},&quot;Level 6&quot;:{},&quot;Level 7&quot;:{},&quot;Level 8&quot;:{},&quot;Level 9&quot;:{},&quot;Prestidigitation&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*Transmutation cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 10 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Up to 1 hour  \n\n---\n\nThis spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice.

The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.\n\nYou can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.\n\nThe hand can&apos;t attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Fire Bolt&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*Evocation cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 120 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n\n---\n\nYou hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes [1d10 fire damage](roll \&quot;1d10\&quot;). A flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isn&apos;t being worn or carried.\n\nThis spell&apos;s damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level ([2d10](roll \&quot;2d10\&quot;)), 11th level ([3d10](roll \&quot;3d10\&quot;)), and 17th level ([4d10](roll \&quot;4d10\&quot;)).&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Thaumaturgy&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*Transmutation cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 30 feet  \n**Components:** V  \n**Duration:** Up to 1 minute\n\n---\n\nYou manifest a minor wonder, a sign of supernatural power, within range.

Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it with the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes [1d8 necrotic damage](roll \&quot;1d8\&quot;), and it can&apos;t regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target.\n\nIf you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn.\n\nThis spell&apos;s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level ([2d8](roll \&quot;2d8\&quot;)), 11th level ([3d8](roll \&quot;3d8\&quot;)), and 17th level ([4d8](roll \&quot;4d8\&quot;)).&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Dancing Lights&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*Evocation cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 120 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or a glowworm)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute  \n\n---\n\nYou create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.\n\nAs a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range.

When the spell ends, the creature realizes that you used magic to influence its mood and becomes hostile toward you. A creature prone to violence might attack you. Another creature might seek retribution in other ways (at the DM&apos;s discretion), depending on the nature of your interaction with it.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Light&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*Evocation cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, M (a firefly or phosphorescent moss)  \n**Duration:** 1 hour  \n\n---\n\nYou touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.\n\nIf you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Mending&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*Transmutation cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 minute  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S, M (two lodestones)  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n\n---\n\nThis spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.\n\nThis spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can&apos;t restore magic to such an object.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Minor Illusion&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*Illusion cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 30 feet  \n**Components:** S, M (a bit of fleece)  \n**Duration:** 1 minute  \n\n---\n\nYou create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.\n\nIf you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else&apos;s voice, a lion&apos;s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.\n\nIf you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can&apos;t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.\n\nIf a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Poison Spray&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*Conjuration cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 10 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n\n---\n\nYou extend your hand toward a creature you can see within range and project a puff of noxious gas from your palm.

Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal.

For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon&apos;s damage die becomes a [d8](roll \&quot;1d8+spell\&quot;).

You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can&apos;t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.\n\nThe changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.\n\nTo discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Sleep&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*1st-level enchantment*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 90 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a cricket)  \n**Duration:** 1 minute\n\n---\n\nThis spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll [5d8](roll \&quot;5d8\&quot;); the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures).\n\nStarting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature&apos;s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature&apos;s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.\n\nUndead and creatures immune to being charmed aren&apos;t affected by this spell.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional [2d8](roll \&quot;5d8+2d8*slot1\&quot;) for each slot level above 1st.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Healing Word&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*1st-level evocation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  \n**Range:** 60 feet  \n**Components:** V  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nA creature of your choice that you can see within range regains hit points equal to [1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier](roll \&quot;1d4+spell\&quot;).

The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can&apos;t attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.\n\nOnce on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.\n\nIf you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Mage Armor&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*1st-level abjuration*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of cured leather)  \n**Duration:** 8 hours\n\n---\n\nYou touch a willing creature who isn&apos;t wearing armor, and a protective magical force surrounds it until the spell ends.

Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes [4d6](roll \&quot;4d6\&quot;) radiant damage, and the next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn has advantage, thanks to the mystical dim light glittering on the target until then.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by [1d6](roll \&quot;4d6+1d6*slot1\&quot;) for each slot level above 1st.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Charm Person&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*1st-level enchantment*  \nCasting Time: 1 action  \nRange: 30 feet  \nComponents: V, S  \nDuration: 1 hour\n\n---\n\nYou attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.

Any creature in the area when the spell is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw.

Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw.

On a failed save, a creature takes [2d8](roll \&quot;2d8\&quot;) thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn&apos;t pushed.\n\nIn addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell&apos;s effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.\n\nAt Higher Levels.

You instantly learn the target&apos;s prevailing emotion, whether it&apos;s love, anger, pain, fear, calm, or something else.

The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes [2d4 piercing damage](roll \&quot;2d4\&quot;) for every 5 feet it travels.\n\nThe transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can&apos;t see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Mirror Image&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*2nd-level illusion*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** 1 minute\n\n---\n\nThree illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it&apos;s impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.\n\nEach time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell&apos;s duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.\n\nIf you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack&apos;s target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.\n\nA duplicate&apos;s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.\n\nA creature is unaffected by this spell if it can&apos;t see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Misty Step&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*2nd-level conjuration*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nBriefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Blur&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*2nd-level illusion*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\n\n---\n\nYour body becomes blurred, shifting and wavering to all who can see you.

The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can&apos;t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can&apos;t illuminate it.\n\nIf the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn&apos;t being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.\n\nIf any of this spell&apos;s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Melf&apos;s Acid Arrow&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*2nd-level evocation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 90 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (powdered rhubarb leaf and an adder&apos;s stomach)  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nA shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes [4d4 acid damage](roll \&quot;4d4\&quot;) immediately and [2d4 acid damage](roll \&quot;2d4\&quot;) at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both [initial](roll \&quot;4d4+1d4slot2\&quot;) and [later](roll \&quot;2d4+1d4slot2\&quot;)) increases by [1d4](roll \&quot;1d4slot2\&quot;) for each slot level above 2nd.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Spider Climb&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*2nd-level transmutation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of bitumen and a spider)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour\n\n---\n\nUntil the spell ends, one willing creature you touch gains the ability to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving its hands free.

The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.\n\nIf the webs aren&apos;t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.\n\nEach creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.\n\nA creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.\n\nThe webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Fireball&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;\n*3rd-level evocation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 150 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n\n---\n\nA bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame.

A target takes [8d6 fire damage](roll \&quot;8d6\&quot;) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nThe fire spreads around corners.

Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.\n\nAn affected target&apos;s speed is halved, it takes a −2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can&apos;t use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature&apos;s abilities or magic items, it can&apos;t make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.\n\nIf the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a [d20](roll \&quot;1d20\&quot;).

The food is bland but nourishing, and spoils if uneaten after 24 hours. The water is clean and doesn&apos;t go bad.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Protection from Energy&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level abjuration*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour\n\n---\n\nFor the duration, the willing creature you touch has resistance to one damage type of your choice: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Call Lightning&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level conjuration*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 120 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes\n\n---\n\nA storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see within range directly above you. The spell fails if you can&apos;t see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can&apos;t accommodate the cloud).\n\nWhen you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes [3d10 lightning damage](roll \&quot;3d10\&quot;) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.\n\nIf you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell&apos;s damage increases by [1d10](roll \&quot;1d10\&quot;).\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher level, the damage increases by [1d10](roll \&quot;3d10+1d10*slot3\&quot;) for each slot level above 3rd.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Plant Growth&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level transmutation*  \nCasting Time: 1 action or 8 hours  \nRange: 150 feet  \nComponents: V, S  \nDuration: Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nThis spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits.\n\nIf you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.\n\nYou can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell&apos;s area from being affected.\n\nIf you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Daylight&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level evocation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 60 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** 1 hour\n\n---\n\nA 60-foot-radius sphere of light spreads out from a point you choose within range. The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for an additional 60 feet.\n\nIf you chose a point on an object you are holding or one that isn&apos;t being worn or carried, the light shines from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the affected object with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the light.\n\nIf any of this spell&apos;s area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Haste&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level transmutation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 30 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a shaving of licorice root)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\n\n---\n\nChoose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target&apos;s speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.\n\nWhen the spell ends, the target can&apos;t move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Lightning Bolt&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level evocation*  \nCasting Time: 1 action  \nRange: Self (100-foot line)  \nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of fur and a rod of amber, crystal, or glass)  \nDuration: Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nA stroke of lightning forming a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes [8d6](roll \&quot;8d6\&quot;) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nThe lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren&apos;t being worn or carried.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by [1d6](roll \&quot;8d6+1d6*slot3\&quot;) for each slot level above 3rd.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Meld into Stone&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level transmutation (ritual)*  \nCasting Time: 1 action  \nRange: Touch  \nComponents: V, S  \nDuration: 8 hours\n\n---\n\nYou step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, melding yourself and all the equipment you carry with the stone for the duration. Using your movement, you step into the stone at a point you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses.\n\nWhile merged with the stone, you can&apos;t see what occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use your movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the spell. You otherwise can&apos;t move.\n\nMinor physical damage to the stone doesn&apos;t harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals [6d6 bludgeoning damage](roll \&quot;6d6\&quot;) to you. The stone&apos;s complete destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals 50 bludgeoning damage to you. If expelled, you fall prone in an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Water Walk&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level transmutation (ritual)*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 30 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of cork)  \n**Duration:** 1 hour\n\n---\n\nThis spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface—such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava—as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this ability for the duration.\n\nIf you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the spell carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Gaseous Form&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level transmutation*  \nCasting Time: 1 action  \nRange: Touch  \nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of gauze and a wisp of smoke)  \nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\n\n---\n\nYou transform a willing creature you touch, along with everything it&apos;s wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration. The spell ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature isn&apos;t affected.\n\nWhile in this form, the target&apos;s only method of movement is a flying speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can&apos;t fall and remains hovering in the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated.\n\nWhile in the form of a misty cloud, the target can&apos;t talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can&apos;t be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The target can&apos;t attack or cast spells.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Stinking Cloud&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level conjuration*  \nCasting Time: 1 action  \nRange: 90 feet  \nComponents: V, S, M (a rotten egg or several skunk cabbage leaves)  \nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\n\n---\n\nYou create a 20-foot-radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration.\n\nEach creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling. Creatures that don&apos;t need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw.\n\nA moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Ice Storm&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*4th-level evocation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 300 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nA hail of rock-hard ice pounds to the ground in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes [2d8 bludgeoning damage](roll \&quot;2d8\&quot;) and [4d6 cold damage](roll \&quot;4d6\&quot;) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nHailstones turn the storm&apos;s area of effect into difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage increases by [1d8](roll \&quot;2d8+1d8*slot4\&quot;) for each slot level above 4th.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Control Water&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*4th-level transmutation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 300 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of water and a pinch of dust)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes\n\n---\n\nUntil the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.\n\n***Flood.*** You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.\n\nIf you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave&apos;s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.\n\nThe water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.\n\n***Part Water.*** You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell&apos;s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.\n\n***Redirect Flow.*** You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell&apos;s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.\n\n***Whirlpool.*** This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.\n\nWhen a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes [2d8 bludgeoning damage](roll \&quot;2d8\&quot;) and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn&apos;t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.\n\nThe first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes [2d8 bludgeoning damage](roll \&quot;2d8\&quot;)&amp;#59 this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Blight&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*4th-level necromancy*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 30 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nNecromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes [8d8 necrotic damage](roll \&quot;8d8\&quot;) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\n\nIf you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.\n\nIf you target a nonmagical plant that isn&apos;t a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn&apos;t make a saving throw, it simply withers and dies.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by [1d8](roll \&quot;1d8\&quot;) for each slot level above 4th.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Hallucinatory Terrain&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*4th-level illusion*  \n**Casting Time:** 10 minutes  \n**Range:** 300 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant)  \n**Duration:** 24 hours\n\n---\n\nYou make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren&apos;t changed in appearance.\n\nThe tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn&apos;t obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Divination&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*4th-level divination (ritual)*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V, S, M (incense and a sacrificial offering appropriate to your religion, together worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nYour magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god&apos;s servants. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The DM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.\n\nThe spell doesn&apos;t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.\n\nIf you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Stoneskin&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*4th-level abjuration*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S, M (diamond dust worth 100 gp, which the spell consumes)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour\n\n---\n\nThis spell turns the flesh of a willing creature you touch as hard as stone. Until the spell ends, the target has resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Freedom of Movement&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*4th-level abjuration*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a leather strap, bound around the arm or a similar appendage)  \n**Duration:** 1 hour\n\n---\n\nYou touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target&apos;s movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target&apos;s speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained.\n\nThe target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it grappled. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target&apos;s movement or attacks.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Locate Creature&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*4th-level divination*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fur from a bloodhound)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour\n\n---\n\nDescribe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the creature&apos;s location, as long as that creature is within 1,000 feet of you. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement.\n\nThe spell can locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn), so long as you have seen such a creature up close—within 30 feet—at least once. If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as being under the effects of a polymorph spell, this spell doesn&apos;t locate the creature.\n\nThis spell can&apos;t locate a creature if running water at least 10 feet wide blocks a direct path between you and the creature.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Greater Invisibility&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*4th-level illusion*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\n\n---\n\nYou or a creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target&apos;s person.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Stone Shape&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*4th-level transmutation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S, M (soft clay, which must be worked into roughly the desired shape of the stone object)  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nYou touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn&apos;t possible.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Cone of Cold&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*5th-level evocation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self (60-foot cone)  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a small crystal or glass cone)  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nA blast of cold air erupts from your hands. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes [8d8 cold damage](roll \&quot;8d8\&quot;) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nA creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by [1d8](roll \&quot;8d8+1d8*slot5\&quot;) for each slot level above 5th.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Conjure Elemental&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*5th-level conjuration*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 minute  \n**Range:** 90 feet   \n**Components:** V, S, M (burning incense for air, soft clay for earth, sulfur and phosphorus for fire, or water and sand for water)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour\n\n---\n\nYou call forth an elemental servant. Choose an area of air, earth, fire, or water that fills a 10-foot cube within range. An elemental of challenge rating 5 or lower appropriate to the area you chose appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of it. For example, a fire elemental emerges from a bonfire, and an earth elemental rises up from the ground. The elemental disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.\n\nThe elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don&apos;t issue any commands to the elemental, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.\n\nIf your concentration is broken, the elemental doesn&apos;t disappear. Instead, you lose control of the elemental, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled elemental can&apos;t be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.\n\nThe DM has the elemental&apos;s statistics.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Commune with Nature&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*5th-level divination (ritual)*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 minute  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nYou briefly become one with nature and gain knowledge of the surrounding territory. In the outdoors, the spell gives you knowledge of the land within 3 miles of you. In caves and other natural underground settings, the radius is limited to 300 feet. The spell doesn&apos;t function where nature has been replaced by construction, such as in dungeons and towns.\n\nYou instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area:\n\n- terrain and bodies of water\n- prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or peoples\n- powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead\n- influence from other planes of existence\n- buildings\n\nFor example, you could determine the location of powerful undead in the area, the location of major sources of safe drinking water, and the location of any nearby towns.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Tree Stride&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*5th-level conjuration*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\n\n---\n\nYou gain the ability to enter a tree and move from inside it to inside another tree of the same kind within 500 feet. Both trees must be living and at least the same size as you. You must use 5 feet of movement to enter a tree. You instantly know the location of all other trees of the same kind within 500 feet and, as part of the move used to enter the tree, can either pass into one of those trees or step out of the tree you&apos;re in. You appear in a spot of your choice within 5 feet of the destination tree, using another 5 feet of movement. If you have no movement left, you appear within 5 feet of the tree you entered.\n\nYou can use this transportation ability once per round for the duration. You must end each turn outside a tree.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Dream&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*5th-level illusion*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 minute  \n**Range:** Special  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a handful of sand, a dab of ink, and a writing quill plucked from a sleeping bird)  \n**Duration:** 8 hours\n\n---\n\nThis spell shapes a creature&apos;s dreams. Choose a creature known to you as the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that don&apos;t sleep, such as elves, can&apos;t be contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings, but can&apos;t take actions or move.\n\nIf the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target&apos;s dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target&apos;s dreams.\n\nYou can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target&apos;s sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes [3d6 psychic damage](roll \&quot;3d6\&quot;).\n\nIf you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar portion of the target&apos;s body, the target makes its saving throw with disadvantage.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Passwall&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*5th-level transmutation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 30 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of sesame seeds)  \n**Duration:** 1 hour\n\n---\n\nA passage appears at a point of your choice that you can see on a wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, a ceiling, or a floor) within range, and lasts for the duration. You choose the opening&apos;s dimensions: up to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.\n\nWhen the opening disappears, any creatures or objects still in the passage created by the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the surface on which you cast the spell.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Wall of Stone&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*5th-level evocation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 120 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a small block of granite)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes\n\n---\n\nA nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.\n\nIf the wall cuts through a creature&apos;s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.\n\nThe wall can have any shape you desire, though it can&apos;t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn&apos;t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.\n\nIf you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.\n\nThe wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM&apos;s discretion.\n\nIf you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can&apos;t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Scrying&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*5th-level divination*  \n**Casting Time:** 10 minutes  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a focus worth at least 1,000 gp, such as a crystal ball, a silver mirror, or a font filled with holy water)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes\n\n---\n\nYou can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. If a target knows you&apos;re casting this spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be observed.\n\n##### Knowledge of Target\n\n|Knowledge|Save Modifier|\n|---|---:|\n|Secondhand (you have heard of the target)|+5|\n|Firsthand (you have met the target)|+0|\n|Familiar (you know the target well)|-5|\n\n##### Connection to Target\n\n|Connection|Save Modifier|\n|---|---:|\n|Likeness or picture|-2|\n|Possession or garment|-4|\n|Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like|-10|\n\nOn a successful save, the target isn&apos;t affected, and you can&apos;t use this spell against it again for 24 hours.\n\nOn a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.\n\nInstead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn&apos;t move.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Cloudkill&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*5th-level conjuration*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 120 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes\n\n---\n\nYou create a 20-foot-radius sphere of poisonous, yellow-green fog centered on a point you choose within range. The fog spreads around corners. It lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses the fog, ending the spell. Its area is heavily obscured.\n\nWhen a creature enters the spell&apos;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes [5d8 poison damage](roll \&quot;5d8\&quot;) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don&apos;t need to breathe.\n\nThe fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the ground. The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by [1d8](roll \&quot;5d8+1d8*slot5\&quot;) for each slot level above 5th.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Insect Plague&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*5th-level conjuration*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 300 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a few grains of sugar, some kernels of grain, and a smear of fat)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes\n\n---\n\nSwarming, biting locusts fill a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere spreads around corners. The sphere remains for the duration, and its area is lightly obscured. The sphere&apos;s area is difficult terrain.\n\nWhen the area appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes [4d10 piercing damage](roll \&quot;4d10\&quot;) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell&apos;s area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by [1d10](roll \&quot;4d10+1d10*slot5\&quot;) for each slot level above 5th.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Booming Blade&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*Evocation cantrip*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 5 feet  \n**Components:** V, M (a weapon)  \n**Duration:** 1 round\n\n---\n\nAs part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell&apos;s range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack&apos;s normal effects, and it becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves before then, it immediately takes [1d8](roll \&quot;1d8\&quot;) thunder damage, and the spell ends.\n\nThis spell&apos;s damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra [1d8](roll \&quot;1d8\&quot;) thunder damage to the target, and the damage the target takes for moving increases to [2d8](roll \&quot;2d8\&quot;).

Each creature within range, other than you, must make a Constitution saving throw or take [1d6](roll \&quot;1d6\&quot;) thunder damage.\n\nThe spell&apos;s damage increases by [1d6](roll \&quot;1d6\&quot;) when you reach 5th level ([2d6](roll \&quot;2d6\&quot;)), 11th level ([3d6](roll \&quot;3d6\&quot;)), and 17th level ([4d6](roll \&quot;4d6\&quot;)).&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Dissonant Whispers&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*1st-level enchantment*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 60 feet  \n**Components:** V  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nYou whisper a discordant melody that only one creature of your choice within range can hear, wracking it with terrible pain. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes [3d6](roll \&quot;3d6\&quot;) psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from you. The creature doesn&apos;t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn&apos;t have to move away. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by [1d6](roll \&quot;3d6+1d6*slot1\&quot;) for each slot level above 1st.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Find Familiar&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*1st-level conjuration (ritual)*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 hour  \n**Range:** 10 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (10 gp worth of charcoal, incense, and herbs that must be consumed by fire in a brass brazier)  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nYou gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), hawk, lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish (quipper), rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or weasel. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.\n\nAdditional animal form choices may be available at the DM&apos;s discretion.\n\nYour familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can&apos;t attack, but it can take other actions as normal.\n\nWhen the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again.\n\nWhile your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar&apos;s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.\n\nAs an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.\n\nYou can&apos;t have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.\n\nFinally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Heat Metal&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*2nd-level transmutation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 60 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of iron and a flame)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\n\n---\n\nChoose a manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon or a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, that you can see within range. You cause the object to glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes [2d8](roll \&quot;2d8\&quot;) fire damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause this damage again.\n\nIf a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn&apos;t drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by [1d8](roll \&quot;2d8+1d8*slot2\&quot;) for each slot level above 2nd.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Knock&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*2nd-level transmutation*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 60 feet  \n**Components:** V  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous\n\n---\n\nChoose an object that you can see within range. The object can be a door, a box, a chest, a set of manacles, a padlock, or another object that contains a mundane or magical means that prevents access.\n\nA target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.\n\nIf you choose a target that is held shut with arcane lock, that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and shut normally.\n\nWhen you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible from as far away as 300 feet, emanates from the target object.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Bestow Curse&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level necromancy*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\n\n---\n\nYou touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. When you cast this spell, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:\n\n- Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.\n- While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.\n- While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing.\n- While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra [1d8](roll \&quot;1d8\&quot;) necrotic damage to the target.\n\nA [remove curse](spells \&quot;Remove Curse\&quot;) spell ends this effect. At the DM&apos;s option, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The DM has final say on such a curse&apos;s effect.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is dispelled. Using a spell slot of 5th level or higher grants a duration that doesn&apos;t require concentration.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;Tongues&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level divination*  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, M (a small clay model of a ziggurat)  \n**Duration:** 1 hour\n\n---\n\nThis spell grants the creature you touch the ability to understand any spoken language it hears.

You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.\n\n#### Preparing and Casting Spells\n\nThe Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&apos;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nYou prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&apos;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\n\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\n\n#### Spellcasting Ability\n\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier  \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\n\n#### Ritual Casting\n\nYou can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.\n\n#### Spellcasting Focus\n\nYou can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;divine domain&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Choose one domain related to your deity from the list of available domains.

Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn&apos;t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.\n\nIf you have a domain spell that doesn&apos;t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;life domain&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy—one of the fundamental forces of the universe—that sustains all life.

Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\n\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;high elf&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.\n\n***Age.*** Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.\n\n***Alignment.*** Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others&apos; freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not.\n\n***Size.*** Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.\n\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\n***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

You can&apos;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n\n***Keen Senses.*** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.\nFey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can&apos;t put you to sleep.\n\n***Trance.*** Elves don&apos;t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is \&quot;trance.\&quot;) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.\n\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.\n\n***Elf Weapon Training.*** You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.\n\n***Cantrip.*** You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list.

On average, they live about 350 years.\n\n***Alignment.*** Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order.\n\n***Size.*** Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.\n\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.\n\n***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.

Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.\n\n***Dwarven Toughness.*** Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you\ngain a level.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;lightfoot halfling&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.\n\n***Age.*** A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives into the middle of his or her second century.\n\n***Alignment.*** Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule, they are good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are also very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of their old ways.\n\n***Size.*** Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds.

The Halfling language isn’t secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don’t have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.\n\n***Naturally Stealthy.*** You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;rock gnome&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.\n\n***Age.*** Gnomes mature at the same rate humans do, and most are expected to settle down into an adult life by around age 40. They can live 350 to almost 500 years.\n\n***Alignment.*** Gnomes are most often good. Those who tend toward law are sages, engineers, researchers, scholars, investigators, or inventors. Those who tend toward chaos are minstrels, tricksters, wanderers, or fanciful jewelers. Gnomes are good-hearted, and even the tricksters among them are more playful than vicious.\n\n***Size.*** Gnomes are between 3 and 4 feet tall and average about 40 pounds.

Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time.\n\nWhen you create a device, choose one of the following options:\n\n*Clockwork Toy.* This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction.

They live much longer than humans, however, often exceeding 180 years.\n\n***Alignment.*** Half-elves share the chaotic bent of their elven heritage. They value both personal freedom and creative expression, demonstrating neither love of leaders nor desire for followers. They chafe at rules, resent others&apos; demands, and sometimes prove unreliable, or at least unpredictable.\n\n***Size.*** Half-elves are about the same size as humans, ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.\n\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\n***Darkvision.*** Thanks to your elf blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the hellish rebuke spell as a 2nd-level spell; you must finish a long rest in order to cast the spell again using this trait. Once you reach 5th level, you can also cast the darkness spell; you must finish a long rest in order to cast the spell again using this trait. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.\n\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Infernal.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;dragonborn&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;***Age.*** Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.\n\n***Alignment.*** Dragonborn tend to extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other in the cosmic war between good and evil (represented by Bahamut and Tiamat, respectively). Most dragonborn are good, but those who side with Tiamat can be terrible villains.\n\n***Size.*** Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.\n\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\n***Draconic Ancestry.*** You have draconic ancestry. Choose one type of dragon from the Draconic Ancestry table.

Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.\n\nWhen you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes [2d6 damage](roll \&quot;2d6\&quot;) on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to [3d6](roll \&quot;3d6\&quot;) at 6th level, [4d6](roll \&quot;4d6\&quot;) at 11th level, and [5d6](roll \&quot;5d6\&quot;) at 16th level.\n\nAfter you use your breath weapon, you can&apos;t use it again until you complete a short or long rest.\n\n***Damage Resistance.*** You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.\n\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic.

To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a [d6](roll \&quot;1d6\&quot;).\n\nOnce within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.\n\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\nYour Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a [d8](roll \&quot;1d8\&quot;) at 5th level, a [d10](roll \&quot;1d10\&quot;) at 10th level, and a [d12](roll \&quot;1d12\&quot;) at 15th level.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;spellcasting (bard)&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music.

To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&apos;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.\n\n#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher\n\nYou know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.\n\nYou learn an additional bard spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 16th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\n\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\n#### Spellcasting Ability\n\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier  \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\n\n#### Ritual Casting\n\nYou can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.\n\n#### Spellcasting Focus\n\nYou can use a musical instrument (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;spellcasting (druid)&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will.

You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.\n\n#### Preparing and Casting Spells\n\nThe Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&apos;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nYou prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&apos;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\n\nYou can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\n\n#### Spellcasting Ability\n\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier  \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\n\n#### Ritual Casting\n\nYou can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.\n\n#### Spellcasting Focus\n\nYou can use a druidic focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;druidic&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;You know Druidic, the secret language of druids.

This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.\n- When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven&apos;t already taken a bonus action this turn.\n\nCertain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama).&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;favored enemy&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.\n\nChoose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead.

Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.\n\n### Dragon Ancestor\n\nAt 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.\n\n##### Draconic Ancestry\n\n|Dragon|Damage Type|\n|---|---|\n|Black|Acid|\n|Blue|Lightning|\n|Brass|Fire|\n|Bronze|Lightning|\n|Copper|Acid|\n|Gold|Fire|\n|Green|Poison|\n|Red|Fire|\n|Silver|Cold|\n|White|Cold|\n\nYou can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your Proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.\n\n### Draconic Resilience\n\nAs magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.\n\nAdditionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren&apos;t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;pact magic&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the warlock spell list.\n\n### Cantrips\n\nYou know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.\n\n### Spell Slots\n\nThe Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your warlock spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.\n\nFor example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell witch bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.\n\n### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher\n\nAt 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.\n\nThe Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what&apos;s shown in the table&apos;s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.\n\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\n### Spellcasting Ability\n\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier  \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\n\n### Spellcasting Focus\n\nYou can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;otherworldly patron&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being chosen from the list of available patrons. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;the fiend&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz&apos;Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths.\n\n### Expanded Spell List\n\nThe Fiend lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.\n\n##### Fiend Expanded Spells\n\n|Spell Level|Spells|\n|---|---|\n|1st|[burning hands](level 1 \&quot;Burning Hands\&quot;), [command](level 1 \&quot;Command\&quot;)|\n|2nd|[blindness/deafness](level 2 \&quot;Blindness/Deafness\&quot;), [scorching ray](level 2 \&quot;Scorching Ray\&quot;)|\n|3rd|[fireball](level 3 \&quot;Fireball\&quot;), [stinking cloud](level 3 \&quot;Stinking Cloud\&quot;)|\n|4th|[fire shield](level 4 \&quot;Fire Shield\&quot;), [wall of fire](level 4 \&quot;Wall of Fire\&quot;)|\n|5th|[flame strike](level 5 \&quot;Flame Strike\&quot;), [hallow](level 5 \&quot;Hallow\&quot;)|\n\n### Dark One&apos;s Blessing\n\nStarting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your [Charisma modifier + your warlock level](roll \&quot;cha+warlock\&quot;) (minimum of 1).&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;arcane recovery&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.\n\nFor example, if you&apos;re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots.\n\nYou can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;spellcasting (wizard)&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.\n\n#### Cantrips\n\nAt 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.\n\n#### Spellbook\n\nAt 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.\n\n#### Preparing and Casting Spells\n\nThe Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&apos;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nYou prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nFor example, if you&apos;re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&apos;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\n\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\n\n#### Spellcasting Ability\n\nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your wizard spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier  \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\n\n#### Ritual Casting\n\nYou can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don&apos;t need to have the spell prepared.\n\n#### Spellcasting Focus\n\nYou can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.\n\n#### Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher\n\nEach time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see \&quot;Your Spellbook\&quot;).\n\n```\n##### Your Spellbook\n\nThe spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard&apos;s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.\n\nA spellbook doesn&apos;t contain cantrips.\n\n***Copying a Spell into the Book.*** When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.\nCopying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.\n\nFor each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.\n\nA wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When you copy a spell from a spell scroll, you must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell&apos;s level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.\n\n***Replacing the Book.*** You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.\nIf you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.\n\n***The Book&apos;s Appearance.*** Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.\n```&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;danger sense&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren&apos;t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can&apos;t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;reckless attack&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;primal path&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage from the list of available paths.

The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker&apos;s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.\n\n### Frenzy\n\nStarting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;extra attack&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;fast movement&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren&apos;t wearing heavy armor.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;feral instinct&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.\n\nAdditionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren&apos;t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;brutal critical&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.\n\nThis increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;relentless rage&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you&apos;re raging and don&apos;t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.\n\nEach time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;persistent rage&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;indomitable might&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;mindless rage&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Beginning at 6th level, you can&apos;t be charmed or frightened while raging.

When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.\n\nIf the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can&apos;t use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;retaliation&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you. you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;jack of all trades&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn&apos;t already include your proficiency bonus.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;song of rest&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra [1d6](roll \&quot;1d6\&quot;) hit points.\n\nThe extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to [1d8](roll \&quot;1d8\&quot;) at 9th level, to [1d10](roll \&quot;1d10\&quot;) at 13th level, and to [1d12](roll \&quot;1d12\&quot;) at 17th level.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;bard college&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice from the list of available colleges.

As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;magical secrets&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines.

Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.\n\nThe loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.\n\nThe college&apos;s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.\n\n### Bonus Proficiencies\n\nWhen you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.\n\n### Cutting Words\n\nAlso at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature&apos;s roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage.

You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.\n\nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.\n\nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.\n\nBeginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;divine sense&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.\n\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier.

You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.\n\nThis feature has no effect on undead and constructs.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;destroy undead&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.\n\n##### Destroy Undead\n\n|Cleric Level|Destroys Undead of CR...|\n|---|---|\n| 5th|1/2 or lower|\n|8th|1 or lower|\n|11th|2 or lower|\n|14th|3 or lower|\n|17th|4 or lower|&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;divine intervention&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.\n\nImploring your deity&apos;s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.\n\nIf your deity intervenes, you can&apos;t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.\n\nAt 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;blessed healer&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well.

When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to [2d8](roll \&quot;2d8\&quot;).&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;supreme healing&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;wild shape&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\n\nYour druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn&apos;t have a flying or swimming speed.\n\n##### Beast Shapes\n\n|Level|Max. CR|Limitations|Example|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|2nd|1/4|No flying or swimming speed|Wolf|\n|4th|1/2|No flying speed|Crocodile|\n|8th|1|—|Giant eagle|\n\nYou can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.\n\nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply:\n\n- Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature&apos;s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can&apos;t use them.\n- When you transform, you assume the beast&apos;s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn&apos;t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren&apos;t knocked unconscious.\n- You can&apos;t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn&apos;t break your concentration on a spell you&apos;ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you&apos;ve already cast.\n- You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can&apos;t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.\nYou choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature&apos;s shape and size. Your equipment doesn&apos;t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can&apos;t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;druid circle&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids from the list of available circles. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;timeless body&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can&apos;t be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;beast spells&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren&apos;t able to provide material components.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;archdruid&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.\n\nAdditionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren&apos;t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;circle of the land&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle&apos;s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle&apos;s mysterious rites.\n\n### Bonus Cantrip\n\nYou learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice.\n\n### Natural Recovery\n\nStarting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can&apos;t use this feature again until you finish a long rest\n\nFor example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.\n\n### Circle Spells\n\nYour mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land - arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or Underdark - and consult the associated list of spells.\n\nOnce you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn&apos;t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn&apos;t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.\n\n##### Arctic\n\n|Druid Level|Circle Spells|\n|---|---:|\n|3rd|hold person, spike growth|\n|5th|sleet storm, slow|\n|7th|freedom of movement, ice storm|\n|9th|commune with nature, cone of cold|\n\n##### Coast\n\n|Druid Level|Circle Spells|\n|---|---:|\n|3rd|mirror image, misty step|\n|5th|water breathing, water walk|\n|7th|control water, freedom of movement|\n|9th|conjure elemental, scrying|\n\n##### Desert\n\n|Druid Level|Circle Spells|\n|---|---:|\n|3rd|blur, silence|\n|5th|create food and water, protection from energy|\n|7th|blight, hallucinatory terrain|\n|9th|insect plague, wall of stone|\n\n##### Forest\n\n|Druid Level|Circle Spells|\n|---|---:|\n|3rd|barkskin, spider climb|\n|5th|call lightning, plant growth|\n|7th|divination, freedom of movement|\n|9th|commune with nature, tree stride|\n\n##### Grassland\n\n|Druid Level|Circle Spells|\n|---|---:|\n|3rd|invisibility, pass without trace|\n|5th|daylight, haste|\n|7th|divination, freedom of movement|\n|9th|dream, insect plague|\n\n##### Mountain\n\n|Druid Level|Circle Spells|\n|---|---:|\n|3rd|spider climb, spike growth|\n|5th|lightning bolt, meld into stone|\n|7th|stone shape, stoneskin|\n|9th|passwall, wall of stone|\n\n##### Swamp\n\n|Druid Level|Circle Spells|\n|---|---:|\n|3rd|darkness, Melf&apos;s acid arrow|\n|5th|water walk, stinking cloud|\n|7th|freedom of movement, locate creature|\n|9th|insect plague, scrying|\n\n##### Underdark\n\n|Druid Level|Circle Spells|\n|---|---:|\n|3rd|spider climb, web|\n|5th|gaseous form, stinking cloud|\n|7th|greater invisibility, stone shape|\n|9th|cloudkill, insect plague|&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;land&apos;s stride&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement.

When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.\n\nThe creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;martial archetype&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques, such as Champion.

On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.\n\nWhile raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren&apos;t wearing heavy armor:\n\n- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.\n- When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll. This bonus increases as you level.\n- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.\n- If you are able to cast spells, you can&apos;t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.\n\nYour rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven&apos;t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.\n\nOnce you have raged the maximum number of times for your barbarian level, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.

Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.\n\nYou can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.\n\nWhen you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.\n\nSome of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature&apos;s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:\n\n**Ki save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\n\n### Flurry of Blows\n\nImmediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.\n\n### Patient Defense\n\nYou can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.\n\n### Step of the Wind\n\nYou can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;unarmored movement&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.\n\nAt 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;deflect missiles&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by [1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level](roll \&quot;1d10+dex+monk\&quot;).\n\nIf you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack (range 20/60 feet) with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;monastic tradition&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition, chosen from the list of available traditions. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;slow fall&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;stunning strike&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent&apos;s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;ki-empowered strikes&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;evasion (monk)&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon&apos;s lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;stillness of mind&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;purity of body&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;tongue of the sun and moon&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;diamond soul&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.\n\nAdditionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;empty body&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.\n\nAdditionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the astral projection spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can&apos;t take any other creatures with you.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;way of the open hand&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.\n\n### Open Hand Technique\n\nYou can manipulate your enemy&apos;s ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target.\n\n- It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.\n- It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.\n- It can&apos;t take reactions until the end of your next turn.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;wholeness of body&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;You gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;tranquility&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a [sanctuary](level 1 \&quot;Sanctuary\&quot;) spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus.\n\nSanctuary gives this effect: You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn&apos;t protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.\n\nIf the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, this spell ends.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;quivering palm&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;You gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone&apos;s body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes [10d10 necrotic damage](roll \&quot;10d10\&quot;).&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;monk&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;#### Hit

(paladin)&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the paladin spell list.\n\n#### Preparing and Casting Spells\n\nThe Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell&apos;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nYou prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nFor example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd-level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&apos;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\n\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\n\n#### Spellcasting Ability\n\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier  \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\n\n#### Spellcasting Focus\n\nYou can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;divine health&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;sacred oath&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose from the list of available oaths.\n\nYour choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.\n\n#### Oath Spells\n\nEach oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don&apos;t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.\n\nIf you gain an oath spell that doesn&apos;t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.\n\n#### Channel Divinity\n\nYour oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.\n\nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.\n\nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.\n\n```\n##### Breaking Your Oath\n\nA paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.\n\nA paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all-night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.\n\nIf a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the DM&apos;s discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another, or perhaps to take the Oathbreaker paladin option that appears in the Dungeon Master&apos;s Guide.\n```&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;aura of protection&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1).

Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods&apos; tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants of good—as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.\n\n### Tenets of Devotion\n\nThough the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.\n\n***Honesty.*** Don&apos;t lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.\n\n***Courage.*** Never fear to act, though caution is wise.\n\n***Compassion.*** Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.\n\n***Honor.*** Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them.

See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.\n\n#### Spell Slots\n\nThe Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&apos;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.\n\n#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher\n\nYou know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.\n\nThe Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\n\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\n#### Spellcasting Ability\n\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier  \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;ranger archetype&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate from the list of available archetypes.

For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.

When you attack a creature you can&apos;t see, your inability to see it doesn&apos;t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.

Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn&apos;t employ.\n\n### Fast Hands\n\nStarting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves&apos; tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.\n\n### Second-Story Work\n\nWhen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.\n\nIn addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;supreme sneak&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;use magic device&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you.

For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends.

It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.\n\nYou can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest.

Any cantrip you cast with this feature is considered a warlock cantrip for you. If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron.

You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.\n\nYou might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.\n\n#### Suggested Characteristics\n\nAcolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.\n\n| [d8](roll \&quot;1d8\&quot;) | Personality Trait |\n|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 | I idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly refer to that person&apos;s deeds and example. |\n| 2 | I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working toward peace. |\n| 3 | I see omens in every event and action. The gods try to speak to us, we just need to listen. |\n| 4 | Nothing can shake my optimistic attitude. |\n| 5 | I quote (or misquote) sacred texts and proverbs in almost every situation. |\n| 6 | I am tolerant (or intolerant) of other faiths and respect (or condemn) the worship of other gods. |\n| 7 | I&apos;ve enjoyed fine food, drink, and high society among my temple&apos;s elite. Rough living grates on me. |\n| 8 | I&apos;ve spent so long in the temple that I have little practical experience dealing with people in the outside world. |\n\n| [d6](roll \&quot;1d6\&quot;) | Ideal |\n|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 | Tradition.

You learn additional infusions of\nyour choice when you reach certain levels in this\nclass, as shown in the Infusions Known column\nof the Artificer table.\n\nWhenever you gain a level in this class, you can\nreplace one of the artificer infusions you learned\nwith a new one.\n\n#### Infusing an Item\n\nWhenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a\nnonmagical object and imbue it with one of your\nartificer infusions, turning it into a magic item.\nAn infusion works on only certain kinds of\nobjects, as specified in the infusion’s description.\nIf the item requires attunement, you can attune\nyourself to it the instant you infuse the item, or\nyou can forgo attunement so that someone else\ncan attune to the item. If you decide to attune to\nthe item later, you must do so using the normal\nprocess for attunement (see “Attunement” in the\nDungeon Master’s Guide, page 136).\n\nYour infusion remains in an item indefinitely,\nbut when you die, the infusion vanishes after a\nnumber of days have passed equal to your\nIntelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The\ninfusion also vanishes if you give up your\nknowledge of the infusion for another one.\n\nYou can infuse more than one nonmagical\nobject at the end of a long rest; the maximum\nnumber of objects appears in the Infused Items\ncolumn of the Artificer table. You must touch\neach of the objects, and each of your infusions\ncan be in only one object at a time. If you try to\nexceed your maximum number of infusions, the\noldest infusion immediately ends, and then the\nnew infusion applies.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;tabaxi&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Size: medium  \nSpeed: yes&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]}}</value>

A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.\n\nA coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.\n\n***Innate Spellcasting.*** The hag&apos;s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:\n\nAt will: [dancing lights](level 0 \&quot;Dancing Lights\&quot;), [minor illusion](level 0 \&quot;Minor Illusion\&quot;), [vicious mockery](level 0 \&quot;Vicious Mockery\&quot;)\n\n***Mimicry.*** The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.\n\n***Hag Eye (Coven Only).*** A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes [3d10](roll \&quot;3d10\&quot;) psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.\n\nA hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can&apos;t perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.\n\n***Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only).*** While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard&apos;s spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:\n\n1st level (4 slots): [identify](level 1 \&quot;Identify\&quot;), [ray of sickness](level 1 \&quot;Ray of Sickness\&quot;)\n\n2nd level (3 slots): [hold person](level 2 \&quot;Hold Person\&quot;), [locate object](level 1 \&quot;Locate Object\&quot;)\n\n3rd level (3 slots): [bestow curse](level 3 \&quot;Bestow Curse\&quot;), [counterspell](level 3 \&quot;Counterspell\&quot;), [lightning bolt](level 3 \&quot;Lightning Bolt\&quot;)\n\n4th level (3 slots): [phantasmal killer](level 4 \&quot;Phantasmal Killer\&quot;), [polymorph](level 4 \&quot;Polymorph\&quot;)\n\n5th level (2 slots): [contact other plane](level 5 \&quot;Contact Other Plane\&quot;), [scrying](level 5 \&quot;Scrying\&quot;)\n\n6th level (1 slot): [eyebite](level 6 \&quot;Eyebite\&quot;)\n\nFor casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12 + the hag&apos;s Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4 + the hag&apos;s Intelligence modifier.&quot;},&quot;actions&quot;:{&quot;Actions&quot;:&quot;***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: [+6](to hit \&quot;6\&quot;) to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 ([2d8 + 4](roll \&quot;2d8+4\&quot;)) slashing damage.\n\n***Illusory Appearance.*** The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.\n\nThe changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.\n\n***Invisible Passage.*** The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.&quot;},&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Green Hag&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;MM&quot;],&quot;asset&quot;:&quot;asset://945dd8966ce8ee0c0b11c07d7cf70884&quot;},&quot;grick&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Grick&quot;,&quot;settings&quot;:&quot;size%3DMedium+%26semi%3B+save%3D1+%26semi%3B+skill%3D1+%26semi%3B+dmgVulnerable%3D1+%26semi%3B+dmgRes%3D1+%26semi%3B+dmgImmune%3D1+%26semi%3B+condImmune%3D1+%26semi%3B+variant%3D0&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;monstrosity&quot;,&quot;alignment&quot;:&quot;neutral&quot;,&quot;ac&quot;:&quot;14 (natural armor)&quot;,&quot;hp&quot;:&quot;27 (6d8)&quot;,&quot;speed&quot;:&quot;30 ft., climb 30 ft.&quot;,&quot;str&quot;:14,&quot;dex&quot;:14,&quot;con&quot;:11,&quot;int&quot;:3,&quot;wis&quot;:14,&quot;cha&quot;:5,&quot;DamageResistences&quot;:&quot;bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks&quot;,&quot;senses&quot;:&quot;darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 12&quot;,&quot;languages&quot;:&quot;—&quot;,&quot;challenge&quot;:&quot;2 (450 XP)&quot;,&quot;feats&quot;:{&quot;Features&quot;:&quot;***Stone Camouflage.*** The grick has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in rocky terrain. \n\n&quot;},&quot;actions&quot;:{&quot;Actions&quot;:&quot;***Multiattack.*** The grick makes one attack with its tentacles.

Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.\nWhile in mist form, the vampire can&apos;t take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature&apos;s space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can&apos;t pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight. \n\n ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. \n\n ***Misty Escape.*** When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn&apos;t in sunlight or running water. If it can&apos;t transform, it is destroyed.\nWhile it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can&apos;t revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point. \n\n ***Regeneration.*** The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn&apos;t in sunlight or running water.

The target&apos;s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire&apos;s control. \n\n ***Charm.*** The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn&apos;t under the vampire&apos;s control, it takes the vampire&apos;s requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire&apos;s bite attack.\nEach time the vampire or the vampire&apos;s companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect. \n\n ***Children of the Night (1/Day).*** The vampire magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn&apos;t up. While outdoors, the vampire can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action. \n\n&quot;,&quot;Legendary actions&quot;:&quot;The vampire can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below.

The target&apos;s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount.

Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light.

As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.\n\nThis spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can&apos;t restore magic to such an object.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;minor illusion&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*Illusion cantrip*  \n**Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 30 feet  \n**Components:** S, M (a bit of fleece)  \n**Duration:** 1 minute  \n\n---\n\nYou create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.\n\nIf you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else&apos;s voice, a lion&apos;s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.\n\nIf you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube.

The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.\n\nIf the webs aren&apos;t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn.

On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.\n\nA creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.\n\nThe webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing [2d4](roll \&quot;2d4\&quot;) fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;fireball&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level evocation*  \n**Classes:** Sorcerer, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 150 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n\n---\n\nA bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame.

A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes [3d10](roll \&quot;3d10\&quot;) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.\n\nIf you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one.

You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.\n\nFlood. You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.\n\nIf you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave&apos;s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.\n\nThe water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.\n\nPart Water. You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell&apos;s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.\n\nRedirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell&apos;s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.\n\nWhirlpool. This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.\n\nWhen a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes [2d8](roll \&quot;2d8\&quot;) bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn&apos;t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.\n\nThe first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes [2d8](roll \&quot;2d8\&quot;) bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;blight&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*4th-level necromancy*  \n**Classes:** Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 30 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n\n---\n\nNecromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes [8d8](roll \&quot;8d8\&quot;) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\n\nIf you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.\n\nIf you target a nonmagical plant that isn&apos;t a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn&apos;t make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by [1d8](roll \&quot;8d8+1d8*slot4\&quot;) for each slot level above 4th.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;hallucinatory terrain&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*4th-level illusion*  \n**Classes:** Bard, Druid, Warlock, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 10 minutes  \n**Range:** 300 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant)  \n**Duration:** 24 hours  \n\n---\n\nYou make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren&apos;t changed in appearance.\n\nThe tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn&apos;t obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;divination&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*4th-level divination (ritual)*  \n**Classes:** Cleric  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V, S, M (incense and a sacrificial offering appropriate to your religion, together worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n\n---\n\nYour magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god&apos;s servants. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The GM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.\n\nThe spell doesn&apos;t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.\n\nIf you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading.

For the duration, the target&apos;s movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target&apos;s speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained.\n\nThe target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it grappled.

You sense the direction to the creature&apos;s location, as long as that creature is within 1,000 feet of you. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement.\n\nThe spell can locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn), so long as you have seen such a creature up close—within 30 feet—at least once. If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as being under the effects of a polymorph spell, this spell doesn&apos;t locate the creature.\n\nThis spell can&apos;t locate a creature if running water at least 10 feet wide blocks a direct path between you and the creature.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;greater invisibility&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*4th-level illusion*  \n**Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute  \n\n---\n\nYou or a creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends.

So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut.

Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes [8d8](roll \&quot;8d8\&quot;) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nA creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by [1d8](roll \&quot;8d8+1d8*slot5\&quot;) for each slot level above 5th.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;conjure elemental&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*5th-level conjuration*  \n**Classes:** Druid, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 minute  \n**Range:** 90 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (burning incense for air, soft clay for earth, sulfur and phosphorus for fire, or water and sand for water)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour  \n\n---\n\nYou call forth an elemental servant. Choose an area of air, earth, fire, or water that fills a 10-foot cube within range. An elemental of challenge rating 5 or lower appropriate to the area you chose appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of it. For example, a fire elemental emerges from a bonfire, and an earth elemental rises up from the ground.\n\nThe elemental disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don&apos;t issue any commands to the elemental, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.\n\nIf your concentration is broken, the elemental doesn&apos;t disappear. Instead, you lose control of the elemental, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled elemental can&apos;t be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.\n\nThe GM has the elemental&apos;s statistics.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;commune with nature&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*5th-level divination (ritual)*  \n**Classes:** Druid, Ranger  \n**Casting Time:** 1 minute  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n\n---\n\nYou briefly become one with nature and gain knowledge of the surrounding territory. In the outdoors, the spell gives you knowledge of the land within 3 miles of you. In caves and other natural underground settings, the radius is limited to 300 feet. The spell doesn&apos;t function where nature has been replaced by construction, such as in dungeons and towns.\n\nYou instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area:  \n- terrain and bodies of water  \n- prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or peoples  \n- powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead  \n- influence from other planes of existence  \n- buildings  \nFor example, you could determine the location of powerful undead in the area, the location of major sources of safe drinking water, and the location of any nearby towns.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;tree stride&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*5th-level conjuration*  \n**Classes:** Druid, Ranger  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute  \n\n---\n\nYou gain the ability to enter a tree and move from inside it to inside another tree of the same kind within 500 feet. Both trees must be living and at least the same size as you. You must use 5 feet of movement to enter a tree. You instantly know the location of all other trees of the same kind within 500 feet and, as part of the move used to enter the tree, can either pass into one of those trees or step out of the tree you&apos;re in. You appear in a spot of your choice within 5 feet of the destination tree, using another 5 feet of movement. If you have no movement left, you appear within 5 feet of the tree you entered.\n\nYou can use this transportation ability once per round for the duration.

Choose a creature known to you as the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that don&apos;t sleep, such as elves, can&apos;t be contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings, but can&apos;t take actions or move.\n\nIf the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target&apos;s dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target&apos;s dreams.\n\nYou can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target&apos;s sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes [3d6](roll \&quot;3d6\&quot;) psychic damage.\n\nIf you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar portion of the target&apos;s body, the target makes its saving throw with disadvantage.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;passwall&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*5th-level transmutation*  \n**Classes:** Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 30 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of sesame seeds)  \n**Duration:** 1 hour  \n\n---\n\nA passage appears at a point of your choice that you can see on a wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, a ceiling, or a floor) within range, and lasts for the duration. You choose the opening&apos;s dimensions: up to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.\n\nWhen the opening disappears, any creatures or objects still in the passage created by the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the surface on which you cast the spell.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;wall of stone&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*5th-level evocation*  \n**Classes:** Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 120 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a small block of granite)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes  \n\n---\n\nA nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.\n\nIf the wall cuts through a creature&apos;s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.\n\nThe wall can have any shape you desire, though it can&apos;t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn&apos;t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.\n\nIf you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.\n\nThe wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the GM&apos;s discretion.\n\nIf you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can&apos;t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;scrying&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*5th-level divination*  \n**Classes:** Bard, Cleric, Druid, Warlock, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 10 minutes  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a focus worth at least 1,000 gp, such as a crystal ball, a silver mirror, or a font filled with holy water)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes  \n\n---\n\nYou can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it.

You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.\n\nInstead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell.

The fog spreads around corners. It lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses the fog, ending the spell. Its area is heavily obscured.\n\nWhen a creature enters the spell&apos;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes [5d8](roll \&quot;5d8\&quot;) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don&apos;t need to breathe.\n\nThe fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the ground. The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by [1d8](roll \&quot;5d8+1d8*slot5\&quot;) for each slot level above 5th.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;insect plague&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*5th-level conjuration*  \n**Classes:** Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 300 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a few grains of sugar, some kernels of grain, and a smear of fat)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes  \n\n---\n\nSwarming, biting locusts fill a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range.

Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.\n\nAdditional animal form choices may be available at the DM&apos;s discretion.\n\nYour familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can&apos;t attack, but it can take other actions as normal.\n\nWhen the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again.\n\nWhile your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar&apos;s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.\n\nAs an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.\n\nYou can&apos;t have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.\n\nFinally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it.

While the spell lasts, you can end one option as an action to gain the benefits of a different one.\n\nAquatic Adaptation. You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing webbing between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.\n\nChange Appearance. You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You also can&apos;t appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you&apos;re bipedal, you can&apos;t use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of the spell, you can use your action to change your appearance in this way again.\n\nNatural Weapons. You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal [1d6](roll \&quot;1d6\&quot;) bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes.

Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as \&quot;a man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard\&quot; or \&quot;a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat.\&quot; You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 25 miles for other animals.\n\nWhen the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn&apos;t reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this spell.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3nd level or higher, the duration of the spell increases by 48 hours for each slot level above 2nd.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;animal shapes&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*8th-level transmutation*  \n**Classes:** Druid  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 30 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 24 hours  \n\n---\n\nYour magic turns others into beasts. Choose any number of willing creatures that you can see within range. You transform each target into the form of a Large or smaller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or lower. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to transform affected creatures into new forms.\n\nThe transformation lasts for the duration for each target, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. You can choose a different form for each target. A target&apos;s game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, though the target retains its alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn&apos;t reduce the creature&apos;s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn&apos;t knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can&apos;t speak or cast spells.\n\nThe target&apos;s gear melds into the new form. The target can&apos;t activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;animate dead&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level necromancy*  \n**Classes:** Cleric, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 minute  \n**Range:** 10 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust)  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n\n---\n\nThis spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the GM has the creature&apos;s game statistics).\n\nOn each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.\n\nThe creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you&apos;ve given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert control over two additional undead creatures for each slot level above 3rd.

Choose up to ten nonmagical objects within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium targets count as two objects, Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets count as eight objects. You can&apos;t animate any object larger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or until reduced to 0 hit points.\n\nAs a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.\n\n**Animated Object Statistics**\n\n| Size | HP | AC | Attack | Str | Dex |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Tiny | 20 | 18 | [+8](to hit \&quot;8\&quot;) to hit, [1d4 + 4 damage](roll \&quot;1d4+4\&quot;) | 4 | 18 |\n| Small | 25 | 16 | [+6](to hit \&quot;6\&quot;) to hit, [1d8 + 2 damage](roll \&quot;1d8+2\&quot;) | 6 | 14 |\n| Medium | 40 | 13 | [+5](to hit \&quot;5\&quot;) to hit, [2d6 + 1 damage](roll \&quot;2d6+1\&quot;) | 10 | 12 |\n| Large | 50 | 10 | [+6](to hit \&quot;6\&quot;) to hit, [2d10 + 2 damage](roll \&quot;2d10+2\&quot;) | 14 | 10 |\n| Huge | 80 | 10 | [+8](to hit \&quot;8\&quot;) to hit, [2d12 + 4 damage](roll \&quot;2d12+4\&quot;) | 18 | 6 |\n\nAn animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size. Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form.\n\nIf you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The GM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each slot level above 5th.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;antilife shell&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*5th-level abjuration*  \n**Classes:** Druid  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self (10-foot radius)  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour  \n\n---\n\nA shimmering barrier extends out from you in a 10-foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you and hedging out creatures other than undead and constructs. The barrier lasts for the duration.\n\nThe barrier prevents an affected creature from passing or reaching through. An affected creature can cast spells or make attacks with ranged or reach weapons through the barrier.\n\nIf you move so that an affected creature is forced to pass through the barrier, the spell ends.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;antimagic field&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*8th-level abjuration*  \n**Classes:** Cleric, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self (10-foot-radius sphere)  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron or iron filings)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour  \n\n---\n\nA 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can&apos;t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.\n\nSpells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can&apos;t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn&apos;t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.\n\nTargeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.\n\nAreas of Magic. The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can&apos;t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.\n\nSpells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.\n\nMagic Items. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.\n\nA magic weapon&apos;s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.\n\nMagical Travel. Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.\n\nCreatures and Objects. A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.\n\nDispel Magic. Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field spells don&apos;t nullify each other.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;antipathy/sympathy&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*8th-level enchantment*  \n**Classes:** Druid, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 hour  \n**Range:** 60 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (either a lump of alum soaked in vinegar for the antipathy effect or a drop of honey for the sympathy effect)  \n**Duration:** 10 days  \n\n---\n\nThis spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura&apos;s effect.\n\nAntipathy. The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can&apos;t see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can&apos;t see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.\n\nSympathy. The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can&apos;t willingly move away from the target.\n\nIf the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.\n\nEnding the Effect. If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.\n\nA creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;arcane eye&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*4th-level divination*  \n**Classes:** Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 30 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour  \n\n---\n\nYou create an invisible, magical eye within range that hovers in the air for the duration.\n\nYou mentally receive visual information from the eye, which has normal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet. The eye can look in every direction.\n\nAs an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. There is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it can&apos;t enter another plane of existence.

The hand lasts for the spell&apos;s duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.\n\nThe hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn&apos;t fill its space.\n\nWhen you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it.\n\nClenched Fist. The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes [4d8](roll \&quot;4d8\&quot;) force damage.\n\nForceful Hand. The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand&apos;s Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.\n\nGrasping Hand. The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand&apos;s Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to [2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier](roll \&quot;2d6+spell\&quot;).\n\nInterposing Hand. The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can&apos;t move through the hand&apos;s space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand&apos;s Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand&apos;s Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand&apos;s space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by [2d8](roll \&quot;4d8+2d8*slot5\&quot;) and the damage from the grasping hand increases by [2d6](roll \&quot;2d6+2d6*slot5\&quot;) for each slot level above 5th.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;arcane lock&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*2nd-level abjuration*  \n**Classes:** Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)  \n**Duration:** Until dispelled  \n\n---\n\nYou touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration.

The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.\n\nFalse Aura. You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects, such as detect magic, that detect magical auras. You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change the object&apos;s magical aura so that it appears to belong to a specific school of magic that you choose.

The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn&apos;t need food or air and doesn&apos;t age.\n\nYour astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut—something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does—your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.\n\nYour astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.\n\nThe spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens.\n\nThe spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful dispel magic spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a creature&apos;s original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature&apos;s astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation.\n\nIf you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;augury&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*2nd-level divination (ritual)*  \n**Classes:** Cleric  \n**Casting Time:** 1 minute  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp)  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n\n---\n\nBy casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes.\n\n The GM chooses from the following possible omens:  \n- Weal, for good results  \n- Woe, for bad results  \n- Weal and woe, for both good and bad results  \n- Nothing, for results that aren&apos;t especially good or bad  \nThe spell doesn&apos;t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.\n\nIf you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading.

If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human&apos;s. Your GM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the statistics for the awakened shrub or the awakened tree.\n\nThe awakened beast or plant is charmed by you for 30 days or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it.

You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.\n\nThe creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you have given it.

When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw.

The door is large enough to allow Medium creatures to pass through unhindered. When opened, the door leads to a demiplane that appears to be an empty room 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or stone. When the spell ends, the door disappears, and any creatures or objects inside the demiplane remain trapped there, as the door also disappears from the other side.\n\nEach time you cast this spell, you can create a new demiplane, or have the shadowy door connect to a demiplane you created with a previous casting of this spell.

As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature&apos;s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature&apos;s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature&apos;s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.\n\nQuestions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.\n\nYou can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can&apos;t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can&apos;t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn&apos;t speak any language.\n\nOnce you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can&apos;t see it, but it must still be within range.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;dimension door&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*4th-level conjuration*  \n**Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 500 feet  \n**Components:** V  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n\n---\n\nYou teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range.

Creatures only partially within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area.\n\nA creature inside the cage can&apos;t leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage.

This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to break free.\n\nYou can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling&apos;s normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it.

If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\n\nThe glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.\n\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.\n\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don&apos;t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\n\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.\n\nExplosive Runes. When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes [5d8](roll \&quot;5d8\&quot;) acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nSpell Glyph. You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by [1d8](roll \&quot;5d8+1d8*slot3\&quot;) for each slot level above 3rd.

Choose the effect from the following list, or choose an effect offered by the GM. Some of these effects apply to creatures in the area; you can designate whether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that follow a specific deity or leader, or creatures of a specific sort, such as orcs or trolls. When a creature that would be affected enters the spell&apos;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it can make a Charisma saving throw.

The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be bound by the spell; if it succeeds, it is immune to this spell if you cast it again. While affected by this spell, the creature doesn&apos;t need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn&apos;t age. Divination spells can&apos;t locate or perceive the target.\n\nWhen you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment.\n\nBurial. The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it.\n\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.\n\nChaining. Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can&apos;t move or be moved by any means until then.\n\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.\n\nHedged Prison. The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.\n\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.\n\nMinimus Containment. The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can&apos;t be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.\n\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.\n\nSlumber. The target falls asleep and can&apos;t be awoken. The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.\n\nEnding the Spell. During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the GM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature&apos;s name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.\n\nA dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.\n\nYou can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time.

The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, your soul moves into the target&apos;s body, and the target&apos;s soul becomes trapped in the container. On a success, the target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can&apos;t attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.\n\nOnce you possess a creature&apos;s body, you control it. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature, though you retain your alignment and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores.

The place is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can&apos;t attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can&apos;t leave it. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion. When the spell ends, any creatures inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;major image&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level illusion*  \n**Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 120 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes  \n\n---\n\nYou create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can&apos;t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte&apos;s stench).\n\nAs long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.\n\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;mass cure wounds&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*5th-level evocation*  \n**Classes:** Bard, Cleric, Druid  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 60 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n\n---\n\nA wave of healing energy washes out from a point of your choice within range.

Creatures that can&apos;t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.\n\nEach target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.\n\nYou can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a group of soldiers give all their money to the first beggar they meet. If the condition isn&apos;t met before the spell ends, the activity isn&apos;t performed.\n\nIf you or any of your companions damage a creature affected by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is 10 days.

The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes the maze.\n\nThe target can use its action to attempt to escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends (a minotaur or maze demon automatically succeeds).\n\nWhen the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;message&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*Transmutation cantrip*  \n**Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 120 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a short piece of copper wire)  \n**Duration:** 1 round  \n\n---\n\nYou point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message.

The terrain&apos;s general shape remains the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.\n\nSimilarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where none are present. The spell doesn&apos;t disguise, conceal, or add creatures.\n\nThe illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell&apos;s area disappears immediately.\n\nCreatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain&apos;s true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion&apos;s presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;mislead&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*5th-level illusion*  \n**Classes:** Bard, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** S  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour  \n\n---\n\nYou become invisible at the same time that an illusory double of you appears where you are standing. The double lasts for the duration, but the invisibility ends if you attack or cast a spell.\n\nYou can use your action to move your illusory double up to twice your speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose.\n\nYou can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were located where it is. On each of your turns as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again.

One creature that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target&apos;s memories are modified.\n\nWhile this charm lasts, you can affect the target&apos;s memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.\n\nYou must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature&apos;s memory isn&apos;t altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.\n\nA modified memory doesn&apos;t necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature&apos;s natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The GM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.\n\nA remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on the target restores the creature&apos;s true memory.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target&apos;s memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature&apos;s past (9th level).\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;moonbeam&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*2nd-level evocation*  \n**Classes:** Druid  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 120 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute  \n\n---\n\nA silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range.

If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can&apos;t assume a different form until it leaves the spell&apos;s light.\n\nOn each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by [1d10](roll \&quot;2d10+1d10*slot2\&quot;) for each slot level above 2nd.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;move earth&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*6th-level transmutation*  \n**Classes:** Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 120 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (an iron blade and a small bag containing a mixture of soils—clay, loam, and sand)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 2 hours  \n\n---\n\nChoose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area&apos;s elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can&apos;t exceed half the area&apos;s largest dimension. So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square&apos;s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.\n\nAt the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of terrain to affect.\n\nBecause the terrain&apos;s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area can&apos;t usually be trapped or injured by the ground&apos;s movement.\n\nThis spell can&apos;t manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.\n\nSimilarly, this spell doesn&apos;t directly affect plant growth.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes frightened for the duration. At the end of each of the target&apos;s turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take [4d10](roll \&quot;4d10\&quot;) psychic damage.

Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.\n\nFor the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;planar ally&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*6th-level conjuration*  \n**Classes:** Cleric  \n**Casting Time:** 10 minutes  \n**Range:** 60 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n\n---\n\nYou beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature&apos;s name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (GM&apos;s choice).\n\nWhen the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn&apos;t obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.\n\nPayment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The GM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature&apos;s ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.\n\nAfter the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature&apos;s service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.\n\nA creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;planar binding&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*5th-level abjuration*  \n**Classes:** Bard, Cleric, Druid, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 hour  \n**Range:** 60 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a jewel worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)  \n**Duration:** 24 hours  \n\n---\n\nWith this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned into the center of an inverted magic circle in order to keep it trapped while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by another spell, that spell&apos;s duration is extended to match the duration of this spell.\n\nA bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of a higher level, the duration increases to 10 days with a 6th-level slot, to 30 days with a 7th-level slot, to 180 days with an 8th-level slot, and to a year and a day with a 9th-level spell slot.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;plane shift&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*7th-level conjuration*  \n**Classes:** Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a forked, metal rod worth at least 250 gp, attuned to a particular plane of existence)  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n\n---\n\nYou and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as a city on an Elemental Plane or a palace in Hell, and you appear in or near that destination. If you are trying to reach a city, for example, you might arrive in a street, before a gate, or looking at the city from across a sea, at the GM&apos;s discretion.\n\nAlternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.\n\nYou can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails this save, it is transported to a random location on the plane of existence you specify.

An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.\n\nThe transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target&apos;s (or the target&apos;s level, if it doesn&apos;t have a challenge rating). The target&apos;s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.\n\nThe target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn&apos;t reduce the creature&apos;s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn&apos;t knocked unconscious.\n\nThe creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can&apos;t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.\n\nThe target&apos;s gear melds into the new form.

The target takes [10d6](roll \&quot;10d6\&quot;) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nOrange. The target takes [10d6](roll \&quot;10d6\&quot;) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nYellow. The target takes [10d6](roll \&quot;10d6\&quot;) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nGreen. The target takes [10d6](roll \&quot;10d6\&quot;) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nBlue. The target takes [10d6](roll \&quot;10d6\&quot;) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nIndigo. On a failed save, the target is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don&apos;t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.\n\nViolet. On a failed save, the target is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of existence of the GM&apos;s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn&apos;t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)\n\nSpecial. The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice more, rerolling any 8.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;prismatic wall&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*9th-level abjuration*  \n**Classes:** Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 60 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** 10 minutes  \n\n---\n\nA shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall—up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick—centered on a point you can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted.\n\nThe wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.\n\nThe wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall&apos;s layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer&apos;s properties as described below.\n\nThe wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. A rod of cancellation destroys a prismatic wall, but an antimagic field has no effect on it.\n\nRed. The creature takes [10d6](roll \&quot;10d6\&quot;) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can&apos;t pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.\n\nOrange. The creature takes [10d6](roll \&quot;10d6\&quot;) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can&apos;t pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.\n\nYellow. The creature takes [10d6](roll \&quot;10d6\&quot;) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.\n\nGreen. The creature takes [10d6](roll \&quot;10d6\&quot;) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A passwall spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.\n\nBlue. The creature takes [10d6](roll \&quot;10d6\&quot;) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.\n\nIndigo. On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and failures don&apos;t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind.\n\nWhile this layer is in place, spells can&apos;t be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.\n\nViolet. On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the GM&apos;s choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn&apos;t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a dispel magic spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;private sanctum&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*4th-level abjuration*  \n**Classes:** Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 10 minutes  \n**Range:** 120 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a thin sheet of lead, a piece of opaque glass, a wad of cotton or cloth, and powdered chrysolite)  \n**Duration:** 24 hours  \n\n---\n\nYou make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.\n\nWhen you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:  \n- Sound can&apos;t pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.  \n- The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision) through it.  \n- Sensors created by divination spells can&apos;t appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.  \n- Creatures in the area can&apos;t be targeted by divination spells.  \n- Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.  \n- Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.\n\nCasting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th.

The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.\n\nWhen the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.\n\nThe triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.\n\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.\n\nYou can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.\n\nYou can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.\n\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

This spell doesn&apos;t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren&apos;t first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The spell can&apos;t return an undead creature to life.\n\nThis spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn&apos;t restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—the spell automatically fails.\n\nComing back from the dead is an ordeal.

An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.\n\nNothing—not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects—can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can&apos;t be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.\n\nThe sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere&apos;s walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature&apos;s speed.

All creatures and objects that aren&apos;t somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall.\n\nIf some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal downward fall.

You must touch the chest and the miniature replica that serves as a material component for the spell. The chest can contain up to 12 cubic feet of nonliving material (3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet).\n\nWhile the chest remains on the Ethereal Plane, you can use an action and touch the replica to recall the chest. It appears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you. You can send the chest back to the Ethereal Plane by using an action and touching both the chest and the replica.\n\nAfter 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance per day that the spell&apos;s effect ends.

You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.\n\nThe spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can&apos;t change a target&apos;s body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.\n\nThe changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature&apos;s outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature&apos;s head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.\n\nA creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the creature&apos;s bonus in place of yours. You can&apos;t use any legendary actions or lair actions of the new form.\n\nYou assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn&apos;t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren&apos;t knocked unconscious.\n\nYou retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically capable of doing so. You can&apos;t use any special senses you have (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak.\n\nWhen you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal. The GM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature&apos;s shape and size. Your equipment doesn&apos;t change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can&apos;t wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.\n\nDuring this spell&apos;s duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;shatter&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*2nd-level evocation*  \n**Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 60 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a chip of mica)  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n\n---\n\nA sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range.

The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn&apos;t accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.\n\nYou can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.\n\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;simulacrum&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*7th-level illusion*  \n**Classes:** Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 12 hours  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S, M (snow or ice in quantities sufficient to made a life-size copy of the duplicated creature; some hair, fingernail clippings, or other piece of that creature&apos;s body placed inside the snow or ice; and powdered ruby worth 1,500 gp, sprinkled over the duplicate and consumed by the spell)  \n**Duration:** Until dispelled  \n\n---\n\nYou shape an illusory duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is within range for the entire casting time of the spell. The duplicate is a creature, partially real and formed from ice or snow, and it can take actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has half the creature&apos;s hit point maximum and is formed without any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates.\n\nThe simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended spell slots.\n\nIf the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp per hit point it regains. The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts instantly.\n\nIf you cast this spell again, any currently active duplicates you created with this spell are instantly destroyed.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;speak with animals&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*1st-level divination (ritual)*  \n**Classes:** Bard, Druid, Ranger  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** 10 minutes  \n\n---\n\nYou gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts for the duration.

The corpse must still have a mouth and can&apos;t be undead. The spell fails if the corpse was the target of this spell within the last 10 days.\n\nUntil the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn&apos;t return the creature&apos;s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can&apos;t learn new information, doesn&apos;t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can&apos;t speculate about future events.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;speak with plants&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level transmutation*  \n**Classes:** Bard, Druid, Ranger  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self (30-foot radius)  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** 10 minutes  \n\n---\n\nYou imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands. You can question plants about events in the spell&apos;s area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.\n\nYou can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.\n\nPlants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the GM&apos;s discretion. The spell doesn&apos;t enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.\n\nIf a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.\n\nThis spell can cause the plants created by the entangle spell to release a restrained creature.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;spirit guardians&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level conjuration*  \n**Classes:** Cleric  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self (15-foot radius)  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a holy symbol)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes  \n\n---\n\nYou call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you to a distance of 15 feet for the duration. If you are good or neutral, their spectral form appears angelic or fey (your choice). If you are evil, they appear fiendish.\n\nWhen you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. An affected creature&apos;s speed is halved in the area, and when the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes [3d8](roll \&quot;3d8\&quot;) radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or [3d8](roll \&quot;3d8\&quot;) necrotic damage (if you are evil).

When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to [1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier](roll \&quot;1d8+spell\&quot;).\n\nAs a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.\n\nThe weapon can take whatever form you choose.

Lightning flashes in the area, thunder booms, and strong winds roar. Each creature under the cloud (no more than 5,000 feet beneath the cloud) when it appears must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes [2d6](roll \&quot;2d6\&quot;) thunder damage and becomes deafened for 5 minutes.\n\nEach round you maintain concentration on this spell, the storm produces additional effects on your turn.\n\nRound 2. Acidic rain falls from the cloud. Each creature and object under the cloud takes [1d6](roll \&quot;1d6\&quot;) acid damage.\n\nRound 3. You call six bolts of lightning from the cloud to strike six creatures or objects of your choice beneath the cloud. A given creature or object can&apos;t be struck by more than one bolt. A struck creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes [10d6](roll \&quot;10d6\&quot;) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nRound 4. Hailstones rain down from the cloud. Each creature under the cloud takes [2d6](roll \&quot;2d6\&quot;) bludgeoning damage.\n\nRounds 5–10. Gusts and freezing rain assail the area under the cloud. The area becomes difficult terrain and is heavily obscured. Each creature there takes [1d6](roll \&quot;1d6\&quot;) cold damage. Ranged weapon attacks in the area are impossible. The wind and rain count as a severe distraction for the purposes of maintaining concentration on spells. Finally, gusts of strong wind (ranging from 20 to 50 miles per hour) automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar phenomena in the area, whether mundane or magical.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;suggestion&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*2nd-level enchantment*  \n**Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 30 feet  \n**Components:** V, M (a snake&apos;s tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours  \n\n---\n\nYou suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can&apos;t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.\n\nThe target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.\n\nYou can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn&apos;t met before the spell expires, the activity isn&apos;t performed.\n\nIf you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;sunbeam&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*6th-level evocation*  \n**Classes:** Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self (60-foot line)  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a magnifying glass)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute  \n\n---\n\nA beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line.

If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\n\nThe glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it.\n\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.\n\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature&apos;s physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don&apos;t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\n\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.\n\nDeath. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking [10d10](roll \&quot;10d10\&quot;) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.\n\nDiscord. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.\n\nFear. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.\n\nHopelessness. Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can&apos;t attack or target any creature with harmful abilities, spells, or other magical effects.\n\nInsanity. Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can&apos;t take actions, can&apos;t understand what other creatures say, can&apos;t read, and speaks only in gibberish. The GM controls its movement, which is erratic.\n\nPain. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw and becomes incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save.\n\nSleep. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.\n\nStunning.

When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the duration, you can exert your will on one creature or object that you can see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You can affect the same target round after round, or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.\n\nCreature. You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by the creature&apos;s Strength check. If you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of this spell. Until the end of your next turn, the creature is restrained in your telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.\n\nOn subsequent rounds, you can use your action to attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest.\n\nObject. You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn&apos;t being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this spell.\n\nIf the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by that creature&apos;s Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond the range of this spell.\n\nYou can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;telepathic bond&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*5th-level divination (ritual)*  \n**Classes:** Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 30 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (pieces of eggshell from two different kinds of creatures)  \n**Duration:** 1 hour  \n\n---\n\nYou forge a telepathic link among up to eight willing creatures of your choice within range, psychically linking each creature to all the others for the duration.

If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can&apos;t be held or carried by an unwilling creature.\n\nThe destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you.

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy&apos;s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.\n\nOn Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to.\n\nOff Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is [1d10](roll \&quot;1d10\&quot;) × [1d10](roll \&quot;1d10\&quot;) percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.\n\nSimilar Area. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that&apos;s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard&apos;s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.\n\nMishap. The spell&apos;s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes [3d10](roll \&quot;3d10\&quot;) force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;teleportation circle&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*5th-level conjuration*  \n**Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 minute  \n**Range:** 10 feet  \n**Components:** V, M (rare chalks and inks infused with precious gems with 50 gp, which the spell consumes)  \n**Duration:** 1 round  \n\n---\n\nAs you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.\n\nMany major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence—a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the GM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.\n\nYou can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in the same location every day for one year.

No time passes for other creatures, while you take [1d4 + 1](roll \&quot;1d4+1\&quot;) turns in a row, during which you can use actions and move as normal.\n\nThis spell ends if one of the actions you use during this period, or any effects that you create during this period, affects a creature other than you or an object being worn or carried by someone other than you. In addition, the spell ends if you move to a place more than 1,000 feet from the location where you cast it.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;tiny hut&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level evocation (ritual)*  \n**Classes:** Bard, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 minute  \n**Range:** Self (10-foot-radius hemisphere)  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a small crystal bead)  \n**Duration:** 8 hours  \n\n---\n\nA 10-foot-radius immobile dome of force springs into existence around and above you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell ends if you leave its area.\n\nNine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome with you. The spell fails if its area includes a larger creature or more than nine creatures. Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it. Spells and other magical effects can&apos;t extend through the dome or be cast through it. The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.\n\nUntil the spell ends, you can command the interior to become dimly lit or dark. The dome is opaque from the outside, of any color you choose, but it is transparent from the inside.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;transport via plants&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*6th-level conjuration*  \n**Classes:** Druid  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 10 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** 1 round  \n\n---\n\nThis spell creates a magical link between a Large or larger inanimate plant within range and another plant, at any distance, on the same plane of existence. You must have seen or touched the destination plant at least once before. For the duration, any creature can step into the target plant and exit from the destination plant by using 5 feet of movement.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;true polymorph&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*9th-level transmutation*  \n**Classes:** Bard, Warlock, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 30 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of mercury, a dollop of gum arabic, and a wisp of smoke)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour  \n\n---\n\nChoose one creature or nonmagical object that you can see within range. You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into an object, or the object into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried by another creature). The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation lasts until it is dispelled.\n\nThis spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn&apos;t affected by this spell.\n\nCreature into Creature. If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target&apos;s (or its level, if the target doesn&apos;t have a challenge rating). The target&apos;s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form. It retains its alignment and personality.\n\nThe target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn&apos;t reduce the creature&apos;s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn&apos;t knocked unconscious.\n\nThe creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can&apos;t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech, unless its new form is capable of such actions.\n\nThe target&apos;s gear melds into the new form. The creature can&apos;t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.\n\nObject into Creature. You can turn an object into any kind of creature, as long as the creature&apos;s size is no larger than the object&apos;s size and the creature&apos;s challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your turns. You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The GM has the creature&apos;s statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.\n\nIf the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated it.\n\nCreature into Object. If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form. The creature&apos;s statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the spell ends and it returns to its normal form.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;true resurrection&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*9th-level necromancy*  \n**Classes:** Cleric, Druid  \n**Casting Time:** 1 hour  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a sprinkle of holy water and diamonds worth at least 25,000 gp, which the spell consumes)  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n\n---\n\nYou touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years and that died for any reason except old age. If the creature&apos;s soul is free and willing, the creature is restored to life with all its hit points.\n\nThis spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases, and lifts any curses affecting the creature when it died. The spell replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs.\n\nThe spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists, in which case you must speak the creature&apos;s name.

You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.\n\nWhen the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes [5d8](roll \&quot;5d8\&quot;) fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.\n\nOne side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals [5d8](roll \&quot;5d8\&quot;) fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by [1d8](roll \&quot;5d8+1d8*slot4\&quot;) for each slot level above 4th.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;wall of force&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*5th-level evocation*  \n**Classes:** Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 120 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powder made by crushing a clear gemstone)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes  \n\n---\n\nAn invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature&apos;s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).\n\nNothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can&apos;t be dispelled by dispel magic. A disintegrate spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;wall of ice&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*6th-level evocation*  \n**Classes:** Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 120 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a small piece of quartz)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes  \n\n---\n\nYou create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.\n\nIf the wall cuts through a creature&apos;s space when it appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes [10d6](roll \&quot;10d6\&quot;) cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.\n\nThe wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot section, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution saving throw. That creature takes [5d6](roll \&quot;5d6\&quot;) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage the wall deals when it appears increases by 2d6, and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by [1d6](roll \&quot;10d6+1d6*slot6\&quot;) for each slot level above 6th.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;wall of thorns&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*6th-level conjuration*  \n**Classes:** Druid  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 120 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a handful of thorns)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes  \n\n---\n\nYou create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.\n\nWhen the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes [7d8](roll \&quot;7d8\&quot;) piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.\n\nA creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes [7d8](roll \&quot;7d8\&quot;) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, both types of damage increase by [1d8](roll \&quot;7d8+1d8*slot6\&quot;) for each slot level above 6th.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;warding bond&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*2nd-level abjuration*  \n**Classes:** Cleric  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Touch  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a pair of platinum rings worth at least 50 gp each, which you and the target must wear for the duration)  \n**Duration:** 1 hour  \n\n---\n\nThis spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.\n\nThe spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures.

Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature&apos;s deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the frightened creature&apos;s turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take [4d10](roll \&quot;4d10\&quot;) psychic damage.

While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is incapacitated and can&apos;t move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.\n\nIf a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can&apos;t land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;wind wall&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*3rd-level evocation*  \n**Classes:** Druid, Ranger  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 120 feet  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny fan and a feather of exotic origin)  \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute  \n\n---\n\nA wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration.\n\nWhen the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. A creature takes [3d8](roll \&quot;3d8\&quot;) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nThe strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can&apos;t pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form can&apos;t pass through it.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;wish&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*9th-level conjuration*  \n**Classes:** Sorcerer, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** Self  \n**Components:** V  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n\n---\n\nWish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.\n\nThe basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don&apos;t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.\n\nAlternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:  \n- You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn&apos;t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.  \n- You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.  \n- You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.  \n- You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich&apos;s life drain attack.  \n- You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent&apos;s successful save, a foe&apos;s critical hit, or a friend&apos;s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.\n\nYou might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item&apos;s current owner.\n\nThe stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take [1d10](roll \&quot;1d10\&quot;) necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can&apos;t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn&apos;t 3 or lower already, for [2d4](roll \&quot;2d4\&quot;) days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;word of recall&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*6th-level conjuration*  \n**Classes:** Cleric  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 5 feet  \n**Components:** V  \n**Duration:** Instantaneous  \n\n---\n\nYou and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary. You and any creatures that teleport with you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you designated when you prepared your sanctuary (see below). If you cast this spell without first preparing a sanctuary, the spell has no effect.\n\nYou must designate a sanctuary by casting this spell within a location, such as a temple, dedicated to or strongly linked to your deity. If you attempt to cast the spell in this manner in an area that isn&apos;t dedicated to your deity, the spell has no effect.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;zone of truth&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*2nd-level enchantment*  \n**Classes:** Bard, Cleric, Paladin  \n**Casting Time:** 1 action  \n**Range:** 60 feet  \n**Components:** V, S  \n**Duration:** 10 minutes  \n\n---\n\nYou create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell&apos;s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can&apos;t speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.\n\nAn affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},&quot;absorb elements&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*1st-level Abjuration*&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;arcane weapon&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*1st-level*&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;catapult&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*1st-level*&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;snare&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*1st-level*&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]}}</value>

The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon&apos;s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon&apos;s maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can&apos;t attack a target beyond the weapon&apos;s long range.\n\n***Ammunition.*** You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.\nIf you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.\n\n***Heavy.*** Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons.

The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take [1d4](roll \&quot;1d4\&quot;) piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;traveler&apos;s clothes&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*Adventuring gear*  \n2 gp, 4 lb.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;crossbow bolt case&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*Adventuring gear*  \n1 gp, 1 lb.\n\n---\n\nThis wooden case can hold up to twenty crossbow bolts.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;badge&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},&quot;healer&apos;s kit&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*Adventuring gear*  \n5 gp, 3 lb.\n\n---\n\nThis kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints.

You can&apos;t use this feature on an undead or a construct.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;channel divinity: sacred weapon&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.\n\nYou can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action.

You can&apos;t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you&apos;ve learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.\n\nOn your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell&apos;s level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},&quot;eldritch invocation: chains of carceri&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*Prerequisites: 15th level, Pact of the Chain*\n\nYou can cast [hold monster](level 5 \&quot;Hold Monster\&quot;) at will—targeting a celestial, fiend, or elemental—without expending a spell slot or material components.
