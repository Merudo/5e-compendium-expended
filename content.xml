&quot;grappler&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*Prerequisites: Strength 13 or higher*\n\nYou&apos;ve developed the skills necessary to hold your own in close-quarters grappling. You gain the following benefits:\n- You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature you are grappling.\n- You can use your action to try to pin a creature grappled by you. To do so, make another grapple check. If you succeed, you and the creature are both restrained until the grapple ends.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;spellcasting (cleric)&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for a selection of cleric spells.\n\n#### Cantrips\n\nAt 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.\n\n#### Preparing and Casting Spells\n\nThe Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&apos;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nYou prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&apos;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\n\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\n\n#### Spellcasting Ability\n\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier  \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\n\n#### Ritual Casting\n\nYou can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.\n\n#### Spellcasting Focus\n\nYou can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;divine domain&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Choose one domain related to your deity from the list of available domains. Each domain is detailed in their own feature, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.\n\n### Domain Spells\n\nEach domain has a list of spells—its domain spells—that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn&apos;t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.\n\nIf you have a domain spell that doesn&apos;t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;life domain&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy—one of the fundamental forces of the universe—that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).\n\nAt each indicated cleric level, you add the listed spells to your spells prepared.\n\n##### Life Domain Spells\n\n|Cleric Level         |Spells                                              |\n|:----------------------:|-----------------------------------------------------|\n|1st|[bless](level 1 \&quot;Bless\&quot;), [cure wounds](level 1 \&quot;Cure Wounds\&quot;)|\n|3rd|[lesser restoration](level 2 \&quot;Lesser Restoration\&quot;), [spiritual weapon](level 2 \&quot;Spiritual Weapon\&quot;)|\n|5th|[beacon of hope](level 3 \&quot;Beacon of Hope\&quot;), [revivify](level 3 \&quot;Revivify\&quot;)|\n|7th|[death ward](level 4 \&quot;Death Ward\&quot;), [guardian of faith](level 4 \&quot;Guardian of Faith\&quot;)|\n|9th|[mass cure wounds](level 5 \&quot;Mass Cure Wounds\&quot;), [raise dead](level 5 \&quot;Raise Dead\&quot;)|\n\n### Bonus Proficiency\n\nWhen you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.\n\n### Disciple of Life\n\nAlso starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell&apos;s level.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;human&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;***Ability Score Increase.*** Your ability scores each increase by 1.\n\n***Age.*** Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.\n\n***Alignment.*** Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found among them.\n\n***Size.*** Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.\n\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;high elf&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.\n\n***Age.*** Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.\n\n***Alignment.*** Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others&apos; freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not.\n\n***Size.*** Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.\n\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\n***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can&apos;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n\n***Keen Senses.*** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.\nFey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can&apos;t put you to sleep.\n\n***Trance.*** Elves don&apos;t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is \&quot;trance.\&quot;) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.\n\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.\n\n***Elf Weapon Training.*** You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.\n\n***Cantrip.*** You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.\n\n***Extra Language.*** You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;hill dwarf&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.\n\n***Age.*** Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they’re considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.\n\n***Alignment.*** Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order.\n\n***Size.*** Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.\n\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.\n\n***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n\n***Dwarven Resilience.*** You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage (explained in chapter 9).\n\n***Dwarven Combat Training.*** You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer.\n\n***Tool Proficiency.*** You gain proficiency with the artisan’s tools of your choice: smith’s tools, brewer’s supplies, or mason’s tools.\n\n***Stonecunning.*** Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.\n\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.\n\n***Dwarven Toughness.*** Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you\ngain a level.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;lightfoot halfling&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.\n\n***Age.*** A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives into the middle of his or her second century.\n\n***Alignment.*** Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule, they are good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are also very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of their old ways.\n\n***Size.*** Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.\n\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.\n\n***Lucky.*** When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.\n\n***Brave.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.\n\n***Halfling Nimbleness.*** You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.\n\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling language isn’t secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don’t have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.\n\n***Naturally Stealthy.*** You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;rock gnome&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.\n\n***Age.*** Gnomes mature at the same rate humans do, and most are expected to settle down into an adult life by around age 40. They can live 350 to almost 500 years.\n\n***Alignment.*** Gnomes are most often good. Those who tend toward law are sages, engineers, researchers, scholars, investigators, or inventors. Those who tend toward chaos are minstrels, tricksters, wanderers, or fanciful jewelers. Gnomes are good-hearted, and even the tricksters among them are more playful than vicious.\n\n***Size.*** Gnomes are between 3 and 4 feet tall and average about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.\n\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.\n\n***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can&apos;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n\n***Gnome Cunning.*** You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.\n\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Gnomish. The Gnomish language, which uses the Dwarvish script, is renowned for its technical treatises and its catalogs of knowledge about the natural world.\n\n***Artificer&apos;s Lore.*** Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to magic items, alchemical objects, or technological devices, you can add twice your proficiency bonus, instead of any proficiency bonus you normally apply.\n\n***Tinker.*** You have proficiency with artisan&apos;s tools (tinker&apos;s tools). Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time.\n\nWhen you create a device, choose one of the following options:\n\n*Clockwork Toy.* This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.\n\n*Fire Starter.* The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.\n\n*Music Box.* When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song&apos;s end or when it is closed.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;half-elf&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1.\n\n***Age.*** Half-elves mature at the same rate humans do and reach adulthood around the age of 20. They live much longer than humans, however, often exceeding 180 years.\n\n***Alignment.*** Half-elves share the chaotic bent of their elven heritage. They value both personal freedom and creative expression, demonstrating neither love of leaders nor desire for followers. They chafe at rules, resent others&apos; demands, and sometimes prove unreliable, or at least unpredictable.\n\n***Size.*** Half-elves are about the same size as humans, ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.\n\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\n***Darkvision.*** Thanks to your elf blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.

&quot;half-orc&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.\n\n***Age.*** Half-orcs mature a little faster than humans, reaching adulthood around age 14. They age noticeably faster and rarely live longer than 75 years.\n\n***Alignment.*** Half-orcs inherit a tendency toward chaos from their orc parents and are not strongly inclined toward good. Half-orcs raised among orcs and willing to live out their lives among them are usually evil.\n\n***Size.*** Half-orcs are somewhat larger and bulkier than humans, and they range from 5 to well over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.\n\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\n***Darkvision.*** Thanks to your orc blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can&apos;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n\n***Menacing.*** You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.\n\n***Relentless Endurance.*** When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can&apos;t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.\n\n***Savage Attacks.*** When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon&apos;s damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.\n\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Orc. Orc is a harsh, grating language with hard consonants. It has no script of its own but is written in the Dwarvish script.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;tiefling&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2.\n\n***Age.*** Tieflings mature at the same rate as humans but live a few years longer.\n\n***Alignment.*** Tieflings might not have an innate tendency toward evil, but many of them end up there. Evil or not, an independent nature inclines many tieflings toward a chaotic alignment.\n\n***Size.*** Tieflings are about the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium.\n\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\n***Darkvision.*** Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can&apos;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n\n***Hellish Resistance.*** You have resistance to fire damage.\n\n***Infernal Legacy.*** You know the thaumaturgy cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the hellish rebuke spell as a 2nd-level spell; you must finish a long rest in order to cast the spell again using this trait. Once you reach 5th level, you can also cast the darkness spell; you must finish a long rest in order to cast the spell again using this trait. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.\n\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Infernal.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;dragonborn&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;***Age.*** Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.\n\n***Alignment.*** Dragonborn tend to extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other in the cosmic war between good and evil (represented by Bahamut and Tiamat, respectively). Most dragonborn are good, but those who side with Tiamat can be terrible villains.\n\n***Size.*** Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.\n\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\n***Draconic Ancestry.*** You have draconic ancestry. Choose one type of dragon from the Draconic Ancestry table.

Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.\n\nWhen you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes [2d6 damage](roll \&quot;2d6\&quot;) on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to [3d6](roll \&quot;3d6\&quot;) at 6th level, [4d6](roll \&quot;4d6\&quot;) at 11th level, and [5d6](roll \&quot;5d6\&quot;) at 16th level.\n\nAfter you use your breath weapon, you can&apos;t use it again until you complete a short or long rest.\n\n***Damage Resistance.*** You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.\n\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;bardic inspiration&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a [d6](roll \&quot;1d6\&quot;).\n\nOnce within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.\n\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\nYour Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a [d8](roll \&quot;1d8\&quot;) at 5th level, a [d10](roll \&quot;1d10\&quot;) at 10th level, and a [d12](roll \&quot;1d12\&quot;) at 15th level.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;spellcasting (bard)&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music. Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the bard spell list.\n\n#### Cantrips\n\nYou know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, learning a 3rd cantrip at 4th level and a 4th at 10th level.\n\n#### Spell Slots\n\nThe Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&apos;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.\n\n#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher\n\nYou know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.\n\nYou learn an additional bard spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 16th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\n\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\n#### Spellcasting Ability\n\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier  \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\n\n#### Ritual Casting\n\nYou can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.\n\n#### Spellcasting Focus\n\nYou can use a musical instrument (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;spellcasting (druid)&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will.

You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.\n\n#### Preparing and Casting Spells\n\nThe Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&apos;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nYou prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&apos;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\n\nYou can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\n\n#### Spellcasting Ability\n\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature.

For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven&apos;t already taken a bonus action this turn.\n\nCertain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama).&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},

Only another creature that knows thieves&apos; cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.\n\nIn addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves&apos; guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},

&quot;draconic bloodline&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.\n\n### Dragon Ancestor\n\nAt 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor.

The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.\n\nFor example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots.

&quot;arcane recovery&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.\n\nFor example, if you&apos;re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots.\n\nYou can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;spellcasting (wizard)&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.\n\n#### Cantrips\n\nAt 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.\n\n#### Spellbook\n\nAt 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.\n\n#### Preparing and Casting Spells\n\nThe Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&apos;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nYou prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nFor example, if you&apos;re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&apos;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\n\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\n\n#### Spellcasting Ability\n\nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your wizard spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier  \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\n\n#### Ritual Casting\n\nYou can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don&apos;t need to have the spell prepared.\n\n#### Spellcasting Focus\n\nYou can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.\n\n#### Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher\n\nEach time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see \&quot;Your Spellbook\&quot;).\n\n```\n##### Your Spellbook\n\nThe spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard&apos;s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.\n\nA spellbook doesn&apos;t contain cantrips.\n\n***Copying a Spell into the Book.*** When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.\nCopying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.\n\nFor each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.\n\nA wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When you copy a spell from a spell scroll, you must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell&apos;s level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.\n\n***Replacing the Book.*** You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.\nIf you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.\n\n***The Book&apos;s Appearance.*** Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.\n```&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;danger sense&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren&apos;t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can&apos;t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;reckless attack&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;primal path&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage from the list of available paths. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;path of the berserker&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end—that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker&apos;s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.\n\n### Frenzy\n\nStarting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;extra attack&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;fast movement&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren&apos;t wearing heavy armor.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;feral instinct&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.\n\nAdditionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren&apos;t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;brutal critical&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.\n\nThis increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;relentless rage&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you&apos;re raging and don&apos;t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.\n\nEach time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;persistent rage&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;indomitable might&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;mindless rage&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Beginning at 6th level, you can&apos;t be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;intimidating presence&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.\n\nIf the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can&apos;t use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;retaliation&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you. you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;jack of all trades&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn&apos;t already include your proficiency bonus.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;song of rest&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra [1d6](roll \&quot;1d6\&quot;) hit points.\n\nThe extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to [1d8](roll \&quot;1d8\&quot;) at 9th level, to [1d10](roll \&quot;1d10\&quot;) at 13th level, and to [1d12](roll \&quot;1d12\&quot;) at 17th level.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;bard college&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice from the list of available colleges. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;expertise (bard)&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.\n\nAt 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;font of inspiration&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;countercharm&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;magical secrets&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any classes, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip.\n\nThe chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table.\n\nYou learn two additional spells from any classes at 14th level and again at 18th level.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;superior inspiration&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;college of lore&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.\n\nThe loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.\n\nThe college&apos;s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.\n\n### Bonus Proficiencies\n\nWhen you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.\n\n### Cutting Words\n\nAlso at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature&apos;s roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can&apos;t hear you or if it&apos;s immune to being charmed.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;additional magical secrets&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don&apos;t count against the number of bard spells you know.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;peerless skill&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells you whether you succeed or fail.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;fighting style&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can&apos;t take the same Fighting Style option more than once, even if you get to choose again.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;channel divinity&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.\n\nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.\n\nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.\n\nBeginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;divine sense&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.\n\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;lay on hands&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5.\n\nAs an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.\n\nAlternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.\n\nThis feature has no effect on undead and constructs.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;destroy undead&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.\n\n##### Destroy Undead\n\n|Cleric Level|Destroys Undead of CR...|\n|---|---|\n| 5th|1/2 or lower|\n|8th|1 or lower|\n|11th|2 or lower|\n|14th|3 or lower|\n|17th|4 or lower|&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;divine intervention&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.\n\nImploring your deity&apos;s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.\n\nIf your deity intervenes, you can&apos;t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.\n\nAt 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;blessed healer&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell&apos;s level.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;divine strike&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra [1d8 radiant damage](roll \&quot;1d8\&quot;) to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to [2d8](roll \&quot;2d8\&quot;).&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;supreme healing&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;wild shape&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\n\nYour druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn&apos;t have a flying or swimming speed.\n\n##### Beast Shapes\n\n|Level|Max. CR|Limitations|Example|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|2nd|1/4|No flying or swimming speed|Wolf|\n|4th|1/2|No flying speed|Crocodile|\n|8th|1|—|Giant eagle|\n\nYou can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.\n\nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply:\n\n- Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature&apos;s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can&apos;t use them.\n- When you transform, you assume the beast&apos;s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn&apos;t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren&apos;t knocked unconscious.\n- You can&apos;t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn&apos;t break your concentration on a spell you&apos;ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you&apos;ve already cast.\n- You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can&apos;t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.\nYou choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature&apos;s shape and size. Your equipment doesn&apos;t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can&apos;t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;druid circle&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids from the list of available circles. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;timeless body&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can&apos;t be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;beast spells&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren&apos;t able to provide material components.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;archdruid&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.\n\nAdditionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren&apos;t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;circle of the land&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle&apos;s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle&apos;s mysterious rites.\n\n### Bonus Cantrip\n\nYou learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice.\n\n### Natural Recovery\n\nStarting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can&apos;t use this feature again until you finish a long rest\n\nFor example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.\n\n### Circle Spells\n\nYour mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land - arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or Underdark - and consult the associated list of spells.\n\nOnce you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn&apos;t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn&apos;t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.\n\n##### Arctic\n\n|Druid Level|Circle Spells|\n|---|---:|\n|3rd|hold person, spike growth|\n|5th|sleet storm, slow|\n|7th|freedom of movement, ice storm|\n|9th|commune with nature, cone of cold|\n\n##### Coast\n\n|Druid Level|Circle Spells|\n|---|---:|\n|3rd|mirror image, misty step|\n|5th|water breathing, water walk|\n|7th|control water, freedom of movement|\n|9th|conjure elemental, scrying|\n\n##### Desert\n\n|Druid Level|Circle Spells|\n|---|---:|\n|3rd|blur, silence|\n|5th|create food and water, protection from energy|\n|7th|blight, hallucinatory terrain|\n|9th|insect plague, wall of stone|\n\n##### Forest\n\n|Druid Level|Circle Spells|\n|---|---:|\n|3rd|barkskin, spider climb|\n|5th|call lightning, plant growth|\n|7th|divination, freedom of movement|\n|9th|commune with nature, tree stride|\n\n##### Grassland\n\n|Druid Level|Circle Spells|\n|---|---:|\n|3rd|invisibility, pass without trace|\n|5th|daylight, haste|\n|7th|divination, freedom of movement|\n|9th|dream, insect plague|\n\n##### Mountain\n\n|Druid Level|Circle Spells|\n|---|---:|\n|3rd|spider climb, spike growth|\n|5th|lightning bolt, meld into stone|\n|7th|stone shape, stoneskin|\n|9th|passwall, wall of stone|\n\n##### Swamp\n\n|Druid Level|Circle Spells|\n|---|---:|\n|3rd|darkness, Melf&apos;s acid arrow|\n|5th|water walk, stinking cloud|\n|7th|freedom of movement, locate creature|\n|9th|insect plague, scrying|\n\n##### Underdark\n\n|Druid Level|Circle Spells|\n|---|---:|\n|3rd|spider climb, web|\n|5th|gaseous form, stinking cloud|\n|7th|greater invisibility, stone shape|\n|9th|cloudkill, insect plague|&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;land&apos;s stride&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.\n\nIn addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;nature&apos;s ward&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;When you reach 10th level, you can&apos;t be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;nature&apos;s sanctuary&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.\n\nThe creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;martial archetype&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques, such as Champion. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;extra attack (fighter)&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\n\nThe number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;indomitable&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail.

&quot;ki&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.\n\nYou can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.\n\nWhen you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.\n\nSome of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature&apos;s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:\n\n**Ki save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\n\n### Flurry of Blows\n\nImmediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.\n\n### Patient Defense\n\nYou can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.\n\n### Step of the Wind\n\nYou can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;unarmored movement&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.\n\nAt 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;deflect missiles&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by [1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level](roll \&quot;1d10+dex+monk\&quot;).\n\nIf you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack (range 20/60 feet) with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;monastic tradition&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition, chosen from the list of available traditions.

&quot;stunning strike&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent&apos;s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},

&quot;evasion (monk)&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon&apos;s lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;stillness of mind&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},

&quot;diamond soul&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.\n\nAdditionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;empty body&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.\n\nAdditionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the astral projection spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can&apos;t take any other creatures with you.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;way of the open hand&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.\n\n### Open Hand Technique\n\nYou can manipulate your enemy&apos;s ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target.\n\n- It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.\n- It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.\n- It can&apos;t take reactions until the end of your next turn.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;wholeness of body&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;You gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;tranquility&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a [sanctuary](level 1 \&quot;Sanctuary\&quot;) spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus.\n\nSanctuary gives this effect: You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn&apos;t protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.\n\nIf the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, this spell ends.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;quivering palm&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;You gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone&apos;s body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence.

&quot;spellcasting (paladin)&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the paladin spell list.\n\n#### Preparing and Casting Spells\n\nThe Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell&apos;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nYou prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nFor example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd-level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&apos;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\n\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\n\n#### Spellcasting Ability\n\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier  \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\n\n#### Spellcasting Focus\n\nYou can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;divine health&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;sacred oath&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose from the list of available oaths.\n\nYour choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.\n\n#### Oath Spells\n\nEach oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don&apos;t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.\n\nIf you gain an oath spell that doesn&apos;t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.\n\n#### Channel Divinity\n\nYour oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.\n\nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.\n\nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.\n\n```\n##### Breaking Your Oath\n\nA paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.\n\nA paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all-night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.\n\nIf a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the DM&apos;s discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another, or perhaps to take the Oathbreaker paladin option that appears in the Dungeon Master&apos;s Guide.\n```&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;aura of protection&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.\n\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},

You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;oath of devotion&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods&apos; tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants of good—as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.\n\n### Tenets of Devotion\n\nThough the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.\n\n***Honesty.*** Don&apos;t lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.\n\n***Courage.*** Never fear to act, though caution is wise.\n\n***Compassion.*** Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them.

&quot;spellcasting (ranger)&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does.

To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&apos;s level or higher.

In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier  \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;PHB&quot;]},

Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12.

&quot;acolyte&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;**Skill Proficiencies:** Insight, Religion  \n**Languages:** Two of your choice  \n**Equipment:** A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp\n\n#### Feature: Shelter of the Faithful\n\nAs an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.\n\nYou might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.\n\n#### Suggested Characteristics\n\nAcolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.\n\n| [d8](roll \&quot;1d8\&quot;) | Personality Trait |\n|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 | I idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly refer to that person&apos;s deeds and example. |\n| 2 | I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working toward peace. |\n| 3 | I see omens in every event and action. The gods try to speak to us, we just need to listen. |\n| 4 | Nothing can shake my optimistic attitude. |\n| 5 | I quote (or misquote) sacred texts and proverbs in almost every situation. |\n| 6 | I am tolerant (or intolerant) of other faiths and respect (or condemn) the worship of other gods. |\n| 7 | I&apos;ve enjoyed fine food, drink, and high society among my temple&apos;s elite. Rough living grates on me. |\n| 8 | I&apos;ve spent so long in the temple that I have little practical experience dealing with people in the outside world. |\n\n| [d6](roll \&quot;1d6\&quot;) | Ideal |\n|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 | Tradition.

&quot;infuse item&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;At 2nd level, you gain the ability to imbue\nmundane items with certain magical infusions.\nThe magic items you create with this feature are\neffectively prototypes of permanent items.\n\n#### Infusions Known\n\nWhen you gain this feature, pick three artificer\ninfusions to learn, choosing from the “Artificer\nInfusions” section at the end of the class’s\ndescription. You learn additional infusions of\nyour choice when you reach certain levels in this\nclass, as shown in the Infusions Known column\nof the Artificer table.\n\nWhenever you gain a level in this class, you can\nreplace one of the artificer infusions you learned\nwith a new one.\n\n#### Infusing an Item\n\nWhenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a\nnonmagical object and imbue it with one of your\nartificer infusions, turning it into a magic item.\nAn infusion works on only certain kinds of\nobjects, as specified in the infusion’s description.\nIf the item requires attunement, you can attune\nyourself to it the instant you infuse the item, or\nyou can forgo attunement so that someone else\ncan attune to the item. If you decide to attune to\nthe item later, you must do so using the normal\nprocess for attunement (see “Attunement” in the\nDungeon Master’s Guide, page 136).\n\nYour infusion remains in an item indefinitely,\nbut when you die, the infusion vanishes after a\nnumber of days have passed equal to your\nIntelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The\ninfusion also vanishes if you give up your\nknowledge of the infusion for another one.\n\nYou can infuse more than one nonmagical\nobject at the end of a long rest; the maximum\nnumber of objects appears in the Infused Items\ncolumn of the Artificer table. You must touch\neach of the objects, and each of your infusions\ncan be in only one object at a time. If you try to\nexceed your maximum number of infusions, the\noldest infusion immediately ends, and then the\nnew infusion applies.&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[]},

A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.\n\nA coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.\n\n***Innate Spellcasting.*** The hag&apos;s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:\n\nAt will: [dancing lights](level 0 \&quot;Dancing Lights\&quot;), [minor illusion](level 0 \&quot;Minor Illusion\&quot;), [vicious mockery](level 0 \&quot;Vicious Mockery\&quot;)\n\n***Mimicry.*** The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.\n\n***Hag Eye (Coven Only).*** A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes [3d10](roll \&quot;3d10\&quot;) psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.\n\nA hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can&apos;t perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.\n\n***Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only).*** While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard&apos;s spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:\n\n1st level (4 slots): [identify](level 1 \&quot;Identify\&quot;), [ray of sickness](level 1 \&quot;Ray of Sickness\&quot;)\n\n2nd level (3 slots): [hold person](level 2 \&quot;Hold Person\&quot;), [locate object](level 1 \&quot;Locate Object\&quot;)\n\n3rd level (3 slots): [bestow curse](level 3 \&quot;Bestow Curse\&quot;), [counterspell](level 3 \&quot;Counterspell\&quot;), [lightning bolt](level 3 \&quot;Lightning Bolt\&quot;)\n\n4th level (3 slots): [phantasmal killer](level 4 \&quot;Phantasmal Killer\&quot;), [polymorph](level 4 \&quot;Polymorph\&quot;)\n\n5th level (2 slots): [contact other plane](level 5 \&quot;Contact Other Plane\&quot;), [scrying](level 5 \&quot;Scrying\&quot;)\n\n6th level (1 slot): [eyebite](level 6 \&quot;Eyebite\&quot;)\n\nFor casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12 + the hag&apos;s Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4 + the hag&apos;s Intelligence modifier.&quot;},&quot;actions&quot;:{&quot;Actions&quot;:&quot;***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: [+6](to hit \&quot;6\&quot;) to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 ([2d8 + 4](roll \&quot;2d8+4\&quot;)) slashing damage.\n\n***Illusory Appearance.*** The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.\n\nThe changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.\n\n***Invisible Passage.*** The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.&quot;},&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Green Hag&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;,&quot;MM&quot;],&quot;asset&quot;:&quot;asset://945dd8966ce8ee0c0b11c07d7cf70884&quot;},&quot;grick&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Grick&quot;,&quot;settings&quot;:&quot;size%3DMedium+%26semi%3B+save%3D1+%26semi%3B+skill%3D1+%26semi%3B+dmgVulnerable%3D1+%26semi%3B+dmgRes%3D1+%26semi%3B+dmgImmune%3D1+%26semi%3B+condImmune%3D1+%26semi%3B+variant%3D0&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;monstrosity&quot;,&quot;alignment&quot;:&quot;neutral&quot;,&quot;ac&quot;:&quot;14 (natural armor)&quot;,&quot;hp&quot;:&quot;27 (6d8)&quot;,&quot;speed&quot;:&quot;30 ft., climb 30 ft.&quot;,&quot;str&quot;:14,&quot;dex&quot;:14,&quot;con&quot;:11,&quot;int&quot;:3,&quot;wis&quot;:14,&quot;cha&quot;:5,&quot;DamageResistences&quot;:&quot;bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks&quot;,&quot;senses&quot;:&quot;darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 12&quot;,&quot;languages&quot;:&quot;—&quot;,&quot;challenge&quot;:&quot;2 (450 XP)&quot;,&quot;feats&quot;:{&quot;Features&quot;:&quot;***Stone Camouflage.*** The grick has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in rocky terrain. \n\n&quot;},&quot;actions&quot;:{&quot;Actions&quot;:&quot;***Multiattack.*** The grick makes one attack with its tentacles.

The target&apos;s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount.

Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect. \n\n ***Children of the Night (1/Day).*** The vampire magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn&apos;t up. While outdoors, the vampire can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action. \n\n&quot;,&quot;Legendary actions&quot;:&quot;The vampire can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature&apos;s turn.

The spell ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature isn&apos;t affected.\n\nWhile in this form, the target&apos;s only method of movement is a flying speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can&apos;t fall and remains hovering in the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated.\n\nWhile in the form of a misty cloud, the target can&apos;t talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can&apos;t be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with.

The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration.\n\nEach creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling. Creatures that don&apos;t need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw.\n\nA moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds.

You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.\n\nFlood. You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.\n\nIf you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave&apos;s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.\n\nThe water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.\n\nPart Water. You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell&apos;s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.\n\nRedirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell&apos;s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect.\n\nWhirlpool. This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.\n\nWhen a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes [2d8](roll \&quot;2d8\&quot;) bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn&apos;t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.\n\nThe first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes [2d8](roll \&quot;2d8\&quot;) bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},

The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes [8d8](roll \&quot;8d8\&quot;) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\n\nIf you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.\n\nIf you target a nonmagical plant that isn&apos;t a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn&apos;t make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by [1d8](roll \&quot;8d8+1d8*slot4\&quot;) for each slot level above 4th.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},

Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren&apos;t changed in appearance.\n\nThe tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn&apos;t obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},

You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The GM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.\n\nThe spell doesn&apos;t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion.\n\nIf you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading.

For the duration, the target&apos;s movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target&apos;s speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained.\n\nThe target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it grappled.

You sense the direction to the creature&apos;s location, as long as that creature is within 1,000 feet of you. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement.\n\nThe spell can locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn), so long as you have seen such a creature up close—within 30 feet—at least once. If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as being under the effects of a polymorph spell, this spell doesn&apos;t locate the creature.\n\nThis spell can&apos;t locate a creature if running water at least 10 feet wide blocks a direct path between you and the creature.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},

So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick.

Choose an area of air, earth, fire, or water that fills a 10-foot cube within range. An elemental of challenge rating 5 or lower appropriate to the area you chose appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of it. For example, a fire elemental emerges from a bonfire, and an earth elemental rises up from the ground.\n\nThe elemental disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don&apos;t issue any commands to the elemental, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.\n\nIf your concentration is broken, the elemental doesn&apos;t disappear. Instead, you lose control of the elemental, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled elemental can&apos;t be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.\n\nThe GM has the elemental&apos;s statistics.\n\n***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},

In the outdoors, the spell gives you knowledge of the land within 3 miles of you. In caves and other natural underground settings, the radius is limited to 300 feet. The spell doesn&apos;t function where nature has been replaced by construction, such as in dungeons and towns.\n\nYou instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area:  \n- terrain and bodies of water  \n- prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or peoples  \n- powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead  \n- influence from other planes of existence  \n- buildings  \nFor example, you could determine the location of powerful undead in the area, the location of major sources of safe drinking water, and the location of any nearby towns.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},

Both trees must be living and at least the same size as you. You must use 5 feet of movement to enter a tree. You instantly know the location of all other trees of the same kind within 500 feet and, as part of the move used to enter the tree, can either pass into one of those trees or step out of the tree you&apos;re in. You appear in a spot of your choice within 5 feet of the destination tree, using another 5 feet of movement. If you have no movement left, you appear within 5 feet of the tree you entered.\n\nYou can use this transportation ability once per round for the duration.

&quot;dream&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*5th-level illusion*  \n**Classes:** Bard, Warlock, Wizard  \n**Casting Time:** 1 minute  \n**Range:** Special  \n**Components:** V, S, M (a handful of sand, a dab of ink, and a writing quill plucked from a sleeping bird)  \n**Duration:** 8 hours  \n\n---\n\nThis spell shapes a creature&apos;s dreams. Choose a creature known to you as the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that don&apos;t sleep, such as elves, can&apos;t be contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings, but can&apos;t take actions or move.\n\nIf the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target&apos;s dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target&apos;s dreams.\n\nYou can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target&apos;s sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes [3d6](roll \&quot;3d6\&quot;) psychic damage.\n\nIf you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar portion of the target&apos;s body, the target makes its saving throw with disadvantage.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},

You choose the opening&apos;s dimensions: up to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.\n\nWhen the opening disappears, any creatures or objects still in the passage created by the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the surface on which you cast the spell.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},

The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.\n\nIf the wall cuts through a creature&apos;s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.\n\nThe wall can have any shape you desire, though it can&apos;t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn&apos;t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.\n\nIf you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.\n\nThe wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the GM&apos;s discretion.\n\nIf you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can&apos;t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.\n\n&quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;SRD&quot;]},

You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.\n\nInstead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell.

The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes [8d6](roll \&quot;8d6\&quot;) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, the target also burns for the spell’s duration. The burning target sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the saving throw. It takes [4d6](roll \&quot;4d6\&quot;) fire damage on a failed save, and the spell ends on a successful one.

You choose the devil’s type, which must be one of challenge rating 6 or lower, such as a barbed devil or a bearded devil. The devil appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The devil disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The devil is unfriendly toward you and your companions. Roll initiative for the devil, which has its own turns. It is under the Dungeon Master’s control and acts according to its nature on each of its turns, which might result in its attacking you if it thinks it can prevail, or trying to tempt you to undertake an evil act in exchange for limited service. The DM has the creature’s statistics. On each of your turns, you can try to issue a verbal command to the devil (no action required by you). It obeys the command if the likely outcome is in accordance with its desires, especially if the result would draw you toward evil. Otherwise, you must make a Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion) check contested by its Wisdom (Insight) check. You make the check with advantage if you say the devil’s true name. Ifyour check fails, the devil becomes immune to your verbal commands for the duration of the spell, though it can still carry out your commands if it chooses. If your check succeeds, the devil carries out your command— such as \&quot;attack my enemies,\&quot; \&quot;explore the room ahead,\&quot; or \&quot;bear this message to the queen\&quot;—until it completes the activity, at which point it returns to you to report having done so. If your concentration ends before the spell reaches its full duration, the devil doesn‘t disappear if it has become immune to your verbal commands. Instead, it acts in whatever manner it chooses for [3d6](roll \&quot;3d6\&quot;) minutes, and then it disappears. If you possess an individual devil’s talisman, you can summon that devil if it is of the appropriate challenge rating plus 1, and it obeys all your commands, with no Charisma checks required. \n\n---\n\n**At higher level:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th. &quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;XGE&quot;]},

The area is 120 feet on each side, and it must not have any buildings or other structures on it. Any creatures in the area are harmlessly lifted up as the fortress rises. The fortress has four turrets with square bases, each one 20 feet on a side and 30 feet tall, with one turret on each corner. The turrets are connected to each other by stone walls that are each 80 feet long, creating an enclosed area. Each wall is 1 foot thick and is composed of panels that are 10 feet wide and 20 feet tall. Each panel is contiguous with two other panels or one other panel and a turret. You can place up to four stone doors in the fortress’s outer wall. A small keep stands inside the enclosed area. The keep has a square base that is 50 feet on each side, and it has three floors with 10-foot-high ceilings. Each of the floors can be divided into as many rooms as you like, provided each room is at least 5 feet on each side. The floors of the keep are connected by stone staircases, its walls are 6 inches thick, and interior rooms can have stone doors or open archways as you choose. The keep is furnished and decorated however you like, and it contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people each day. Furnishings, food, and other objects created by this spell crumble to dust if removed from the fortress. A staff of one hundred invisible servants obeys anycommand given to them by creatures you designate when you cast the spell. Each servant functions as if created by the unseen servant spell. The walls, turrets, and keep are all made of stone that can be damaged. Each 10—foot—bya10-foot section of stone has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. It is immune to poison and psychic damage. Reducing a section of stone to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected sections to buckle and collapse at the DM’s discretion. After 7 days or when you cast this spell somewhere else, the fortress harmlessly crumbles and sinks back into the ground, leaving any creatures that were inside it safely on the ground. Casting this spell on the same spot once every 7 days for a year makes the fortress permanent. &quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;XGE&quot;]},

You manipulate it in one of the following ways: • If you target an area of loose earth, you can instantaneously excavate it, move it along the ground, and deposit it up to 5 feet away. This movement doesn’t have enough force to cause damage. • You cause shapes, colors, or both to appear on the dirt or stone, spelling out words, creating images, or shaping patterns. The changes last for 1 hour. • If the dirt or stone you target is on the ground, you cause it to become difficult terrain. Alternatively, you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already difficult terrain. This change lasts for 1 hour.

The hound is invisible to all creatures except you and can’t be harmed. When a Small or larger creature comes within 30 feet of it without first speaking the password that you specify when you cast this spell, the hound starts barking loudly. The hound sees invisible creatures and can see into the Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions. At the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one creature within 5 feet of it that is hostile to you. The hound’s attack bonus is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.

You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open. You can open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is invisible. Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm. You can create any floor plan you like, but the space can’t exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a ninecourse banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can’t attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can’t leave it.

The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it. When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties: * Sound can’t pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area. * The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision) through it. * Sensors created by divination spells can’t appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter. * Creatures in the area can’t be targeted by divination spells. * Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area. * Planar travel is blocked within the warded area. Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent. \n\n---\n\n**At higher level:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th.

It lasts for the duration. When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target of your choice within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit. the target takes [3d10](roll \&quot;3d10\&quot;) force damage. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a spot you can see and repeat this attack against the same target or a different one. &quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;negative energy flood&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*5 level, Necromancy* \n **Casting time:** 1 Action \n**Range:** 60 feet \n**Duration:** Instantaneous \n**Components:** (a broken bone and a square of black silk) \n\n---\n\n You send ribbons of negative energy at one creature you can see within range. Unless the target is undead, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking [5d12](roll \&quot;5d12\&quot;) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A target killed by this damage rises up as a zombie at the start of your next turn. The zombie pursues whatever creature it can see that is closest to it. Statistics for the zombie are in the Monster Manual. If you target an undead with this spell, the target doesn’t make a saving throw. Instead, roll [5d12](roll \&quot;5d12\&quot;).

The target can be a willing creature or an object that isn’t being carried or worn by another creature. When you cast the spell, choose one or both of the following effects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled. False Aura You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects, such as detect magic, that detect magical auras. You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change the object’s magical aura so that it appears to belong to a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item. Mask You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect creature types, such as a paladin’s Divine Sense or the trigger of a sym bol spell. You choose a creature type and other spells and magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of that type or of that alignment. &quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;PHB&quot;]},

Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes [10d6](roll \&quot;10d6\&quot;) cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. If the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to break free. You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling’s normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn’t already shattered, it explodes. \n\n---\n\n**At higher level:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by [1d6](roll \&quot;10d6+1d6*slot6\&quot;) for each slot level above 6th &quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;PHB&quot;]},

An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration. Nothing---not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects---can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside can’t be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it. The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere’s walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature’s speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures. A disintegrate spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it. &quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;otto’s irresistible dance&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*6 level, Enchantment* \n **Casting time:** 1 Action \n**Range:** 30 feet \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute \n**Components:** V \n\n---\n\n Choose one creature that you can see within range. The target begins a comic dance in place: shuffling, tapping its feet, and capering for the duration. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this spell. A dancing creature must use all its movement to dance without leaving its space and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls. While the target is affected by this spell, other creatures have advantage on attack rolls against it. As an action, a dancing creature makes a Wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself. On a successful save, the spell ends. &quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;phantasmal force&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*2 level, Illusion* \n **Casting time:** 1 Action \n**Range:** 60 feet \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute \n**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece) \n\n---\n\n You craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs. The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature. The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends. While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off. An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm’s reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal [1d6](roll \&quot;1d6\&quot;) psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm’s area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion. &quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;PHB&quot;]},

If the target has 100 hit points or fewer, it is subject to crippling pain. Otherwise, the spell has no effect on it. A target is also unaffected if it is immune to being charmed. While the target is affected by crippling pain, any speed it has can be no higher than 10 feet. The target also has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, other than Constitution saving throws. Finally, if the target tries to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the casting fails and the spell is wasted. A target suffering this pain can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the pain ends. &quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;XGE&quot;]},

The sphere remains for the spell’s duration. Each creature in the sphere when it appears or that ends its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take [2d6](roll \&quot;2d6\&quot;) bludgeoning damage. The sphere’s space is difficult terrain. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the center of the sphere toward one creature you choose within 60 feet of the center. Make a ranged spell attack. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is in the sphere. On a hit, the target takes [4d6](roll \&quot;4d6\&quot;) lightning damage. Creatures within 30 feet of the sphere have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to listen. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases for each of its effects by [1d6](roll \&quot;4d6+1d6*slot4\&quot;) for each slot level above 4th. &quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;EEPC&quot;]},
&quot;summon greater demon&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*4 level, Conjuration* \n **Casting time:** 1 Action \n**Range:** 60 feet \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour \n**Components:** V, S, M (a vial of blood from a \n\n---\n\n humanoid killed within the past 24 hours) You utter foul words, summoning one demon from the chaos of the Abyss. You choose the demon’s type, which must be one of challenge rating 5 or lower, such as a shadow demon or a barlgura. The demon appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range, and the demon disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. Roll initiative for the demon, which has its own turns. When you summon it and on each of your turns thereafter, you can issue a verbal command to it (requiring no action on your part), telling it what it must do on its next turn. If you issue no command, it spends its turn attacking any creature within reach that has attacked it. At the end of each of the demon’s turns, it makes a Charisma saving throw. The demon has disadvantage on this saving throw if you say its true name. On a failed save, the demon continues to obey you. On a successful save, your control of the demon ends for the rest of the duration, and the demon spends its turns pursuing and attacking the nearest non-demons to the best of its ability. If you stop concentrating on the spell before it reaches its full duration, an uncontrolled demon doesn’t disappear for [1d6](roll \&quot;1d6\&quot;) rounds if it still has hit points. As part of casting the spell, you can form a circle on the ground with the blood used as a material component. The circle is large enough to encompass your space. While the spell lasts, the summoned demon can’t cross the circle or harm it, and it can’t target anyone within it. Using the material component in this manner consumes it when the spell ends. \n\n---\n\n**At higher level:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 4th. &quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;XGE&quot;]},

A summoned demon disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The demons are hostile to all creatures, including you. Roll initiative for the summoned demons as a group, which has its own turns. The demons pursue and attack the nearest non-demons to the best of their ability. As part of casting the spell, you can form a circle on the ground with the blood used as a material component. The circle is large enough to encompass your space. While the spell lasts, the summoned demons can’t cross the circle or harm it, and they can’t target anyone within it. Using the material component in this manner consumes it when the spell ends. \n\n---\n\n**At higher level:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th or 7th level, you summon twice as many demons.

On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action to make two attacks with a weapon that uses ammunition from the quiver. Each time you make such a ranged attack, your quiver magically replaces the piece of ammunition you used with a similar piece of nonmagical ammunition. Any pieces of ammunition created by this spell disintegrate when the spell ends. If the quiver leaves your possession, the spell ends. &quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;PHB&quot;]},

Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make an Intelligence saving throw. A creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower can’t be affected by this spell. A target takes [8d6](roll \&quot;8d6\&quot;) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After a failed save, a target has muddled thoughts for 1 minute. During that time, it rolls a d6 and subtracts the number rolled from all its attack rolls and ability checks, as well as its Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration. The target can make an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. &quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;XGE&quot;]},
&quot;tasha’s hideous laughter&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*1 level, Enchantment* \n **Casting time:** 1 Action \n**Range:** 30 feet \n**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute \n**Components:** V, S, M (tiny tarts and a feather that \n\n---\n\n is waved in the air) A creature of your choice that you can see within range perceives everything as hilariously funny and falls into fits of laughter if this spell affects it. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall prone, becoming incapacitated and unable to stand up for the duration. A creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or less isn’t affected. At the end of each of its turns, and each time it takes damage, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. The target has advantage on the saving throw ifit’s triggered by damage.

The creature can be anywhere on the same plane of existence as you. The spell ends if you or the target are no longer on the same plane. Until the spell ends, you and the target can instantaneously share words, images, sounds, and other sensory messages with one another through the link, and the target recognizes you as the creature it is communicating with. The spell enables a creature with an Intelligence score of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your words and take in the scope of any sensory messages you send to it. &quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;PHB&quot;]},
&quot;temple of the gods&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*7 level, Conjuration* \n **Casting time:** 1 Hour \n**Range:** 120 feet \n**Duration:** 24 hours \n**Components:** V, S, M (a holy symbol worth at least 5 gp) \n\n---\n\n You cause a temple to shimmer into existence on ground you can see within range. The temple must fit within an unoccupied cube of space, up to 120 feet on each side. The temple remains until the spell ends. It is dedicated to whatever god, pantheon, or philosophy is represented by the holy symbol used in the casting. You make all decisions about the temple’s appearance. The interior is enclosed by a floor, walls, and a roof, with one door granting access to the interior and as many windows as you wish. Only you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell can open or close the door. The temple’s interior is an open space with an idol or altar at one end. You decide whether the temple is illuminated and whether that illumination is bright light or dim light. The smell of burning incense fills the air within, and the temperature is mild. The temple opposes types of creatures you choose when you cast this spell. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. If a creature of the chosen type attempts to enter the temple, that creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it can’t enter the temple for 24 hours. Even if the creature can enter the temple, the magic there hinders it; whenever it makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw inside the temple, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the d20 roll. In addition, the sensors created by divination spells can’t appear inside the temple, and creatures within can’t be targeted by divination spells. Finally, whenever any creature in the temple regains hit points from a spell of 1st level or higher, the creature regains additional hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 hit point). The temple is made from opaque magical force that extends into the Ethereal Plane, thus blocking ethereal travel into the temple’s interior. Nothing can physically pass through the temple’s exterior. It can’t be dispelled by dispel magic, and antimagic field has no effect on it. A disintegrate spell destroys the temple instantly. Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent. &quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;XGE&quot;]},
&quot;tenser’s floating disk (ritual)&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;*1 level, Conjuration* \n **Casting time:** 1 Action \n**Range:** 30 feet \n**Duration:** 1 hour \n**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of mercury) \n\n---\n\n This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground. The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can more across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can’t cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can’t move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom. If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can’t move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends. &quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;PHB&quot;]},

Until the spell ends, you can’t cast spells, and you gain the following benefits: - You gain 50 temporary hit points. If any of these remain when the spell ends, they are lost. - You have advantage on attack rolls that you make with simple and martial weapons. - When you hit a target with a weapon attack, that target takes an extra [2d12](roll \&quot;2d12\&quot;) force damage. - You have proficiency with all armor, shields, simple weapons, and martial weapons. - You have proficiency in Strength and Constitution saving throws. - You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks. Immediately after the spell ends, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion. &quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;XGE&quot;]},

The thunder can be heard from up to 300 feet away. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed what you can carry. You can also teleport one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell, and there must be an unoccupied space within 5 feet of your destination space for the creature to appear in; otherwise, the creature is left behind. \n\n---\n\n**At higher level:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by [1d10](roll \&quot;3d10+1d10*slot3\&quot;) for each slot level above 3rd. &quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;XGE&quot;]},

The target animates and sprouts little arms and legs, becoming a creature under your control until the spell ends or the creature drops to 0 hit points. See the stat block for its statistics. As a bonus action, you can mentally command the creature if it is within 120 feet of you. (If you control multiple creatures with this spell, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one.) You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a simple, general command, such as to fetch a key, stand watch, or stack some books. If you issue no commands, the servant does nothing other than defend itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the servant continues to follow that order until its task is complete. When the creature drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original form, and any remaining damage carries over to that form. \n\n---\n\n**At higher level:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each slot level above 3rd. &quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;XGE&quot;]},

Transmute Rock to Mud. Nonmagical rock of any sort in the area becomes an equal volume of thick, flowing mud that remains for the spell’s duration. The ground in the spell’s area becomes muddy enough that creatures can sink into it. Each foot that a creature moves through the mud costs 4 feet of movement, and any creature on the ground when you cast the spell must make a Strength saving throw. A creature must also make the saving throw when it moves into the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. On a failed save, a creature sinks into the mud and is restrained, though it can use an action to end the restrained condition on itself by pulling itself free of the mud. If you cast the spell on a ceiling, the mud falls. Any creature under the mud when it falls must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes [4d8](roll \&quot;4d8\&quot;) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Transmute Mud to Rock. Nonmagical mud or quicksand in the area no more than 10 feet deep transforms into soft stone for the spell’s duration. Any creature in the mud when it transforms must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is shunted safely to the surface in an unoccupied space. On a failed save, a creature becomes restrained by the rock. A restrained creature, or another creature within reach, can use an action to try to break the rock by succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check or by dealing damage to it. The rock has AC 15 and 25 hit points, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage. &quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;EEPC&quot;]},

On a failed save, a creature takes [6d10](roll \&quot;6d10\&quot;) bludgeoning damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. At the start of each of your turns after the wall appears, the wall, along with any creatures in it, moves 50 feet away from you. Any Huge or smaller creature inside the wall or whose space the wall enters when it moves must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take [5d10](roll \&quot;5d10\&quot;) bludgeoning damage. A creature can take this damage only once per round. At the end of the turn, the wall’s height is reduced by 50 feet, and the damage creatures take from the spell on subsequent rounds is reduced by [1d10](roll \&quot;1d10\&quot;). When the wall reaches 0 feet in height, the spell ends. A creature caught in the wall can move by swimming. Because of the force of the wave, though, the creature must make a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC in order to move at all. If it fails the check, it can’t move. A creature that moves out of the area falls to the ground. &quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;PHB&quot;]},

Spells that deal cold damage that pass through the wall cause the area of the wall they pass through to freeze solid (at least a 5-foot square section is frozen). Each 5-foot-square frozen section has AC 5 and 15 hit points. Reducing a frozen section to 0 hit points destroys it. When a section is destroyed, the wall’s water doesn’t fill it. &quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;EEPC&quot;]},

The sphere can hover in the air, but no more than 10 feet off the ground. The sphere remains for the spell’s duration. Any creature in the sphere’s space must make a Strength saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is ejected from that space to the nearest unoccupied space outside it. A Huge or larger creature succeeds on the saving throw automatically. On a failed save, a creature is restrained by the sphere and is engulfed by the water. At the end of each of its turns, a restrained target can repeat the saving throw. The sphere can restrain a maximum of four Medium or smaller creatures or one Large creature. If the sphere restrains a creature in excess of these numbers, a random creature that was already restrained by the sphere falls out of it and lands prone in a space within 5 feet of it. As an action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet in a straight line. If it moves over a pit, cliff, or other drop, it safely descends until it is hovering 10 feet over ground. Any creature restrained by the sphere moves with it. You can ram the sphere into creatures, forcing them to make the saving throw, but no more than once per turn. When the spell ends, the sphere falls to the ground and extinguishes all normal flames within 30 feet of it. Any creature restrained by the sphere is knocked prone in the space where it falls. &quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;EEPC&quot;]},

The whirlwind is a 10-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered on that point. Until the spell ends, you can use your action to move the whirlwind up to 30 feet in any direction along the ground. The whirlwind sucks up any Medium or smaller objects that aren’t secured to anything and that aren’t worn or carried by anyone. A creature must make a Dexterity saving throw the first time on a turn that it enters the whirlwind or that the whirlwind enters its space, including when the whirlwind first appears. A creature takes [10d6](roll \&quot;10d6\&quot;) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a Large or smaller creature that fails the save must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained in the whirlwind until the spell ends. When a creature starts its turn restrained by the whirlwind, the creature is pulled 5 feet higher inside it, unless the creature is at the top. A restrained creature moves with the whirlwind and falls when the spell ends, unless the creature has some means to stay aloft. A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check against your spell save DC. If successful, the creature is no longer restrained by the whirlwind and is hurled [3d6](roll \&quot;3d6\&quot;) × 10 feet away from it in a random direction. &quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;EEPC&quot;]},

The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else. The spell also ends if the target is ever outside the spell’s range or if it has total cover from you. \n\n---\n\n**At higher level:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial damage increases by [1d12](roll \&quot;1d12+1d12*slot1\&quot;) for each slot level above 1st. &quot;,&quot;sources&quot;:[&quot;PHB&quot;]},

Any area of ground in the cube that is covered by grass or undergrowth is difficult terrain for your enemies. Trees. At the start of each of your turns, each of your enemies within 10 feet of any tree in the cube must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take [4d6](roll \&quot;4d6\&quot;) slashing damage from whipping branches. Roots and Vines. At the end of each of your turns, one creature of your choice that is on the ground in the cube must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained until the spell ends. A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC, ending the effect on itself on a success. Rocks. As a bonus action on your turn, you can cause a loose rock in the cube to launch at a creature you can see in the cube. Make a ranged spell attack against the target.
